        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My methodology is just making lots of pivot tables. What do they want to see? 
 More info: they gave me a list of a dozen questions to answer. All of which were easily answered by cleaning up the data and then making pivot tables. I submitted a report in excel and now I’ve been asked to present my findings. They said my presentation should include my methodology and process. I’m kind of stumped for how to include it in a PowerPoint presentation. 
 Thanks for any insight.

 Few months ago, I started working on a project that requires me to use R to fetch, clean data, do some feature engineering. I&#39;m able to do whatever is required but I&#39;m not sure if my code or rather code snippets are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. I&#39;m not even sure what good or bad means but I&#39;ve seen these words thrown around. 
 Can more experienced people of this sub explain to me what qualifies as a good code?
 Thanks!

 To be honest, I don’t think too much about any coin community. But this conference is showing the world a narrowed profile on what a Bitcoin investor looks like, and it’s making me cringe. 
 It’s also making me happy that most of my friends and family don’t know what I invest in.

 Today, the country of El Salvador has taken one small step for bitcoin, but a giant step forward for humanity.
 Bitcoin is inevitable.
 Edit: This is a proposed bill to adopt bitcoin as the legal tender. Bitcoin will be the currency of El Salvador once this bill is passed.

 Nothing really. I mean I spent more time playing with my kids, went on dates with my wife and even went golfing with my parents. I have always planned on just hodling but always felt compelled to check so often in fear of missing the next great coin or a dip/spike so great I had to buy or sell. You should all try it. 
 That’s all nothing important sorry for wasting your time.

 I recently found out that Carvana lets you use the internet while taking their technical test. They wrote something like this in the email invitation, &quot;We all know everybody googles the syntax on their job&quot;.

 I found it interesting and was wondering what are your thoughts on this. Should more companies start allowing the use of internet in their coding tests?

 Are they technologies used in combination? Is one better for a particular type of data? Are there limitations that means the choice is budget dependent? Or is it just matter of preference?
 Many thanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction!

 Turn off SMS 2FA and set up something like Authy.

 Take the 10-15 minutes to protect yourself. It really doesn’t take that long to set up.

 I am building a website with a rating system and I was wondering if there are any highly recommendable books that could help with designing it.
 I&#39;m interested in anything ranging from details such as designing algorithms to deal with items with fewer ratings having higher average scores (as in, an item with a single 10 rating being ranked higher than an item with a thousand 9 votes) or the arguments behind different rating systems (10 stars, 5 stars, thumbs up/down, subcategory ratings, etc)…]]></summary>

 (2) Given a general task (here&#39;s a website, solve this unspecified CAPTCHA and log me in), what&#39;s the SotA? The task doesn&#39;t need to be a VQA (visual) task but for scope, we can make this assumption for now.

 But I have no idea how to do it. I have a bunch of iPhones I could duct tape to telephone poles with SIM cards and solar batteries.

This is the reason we don’t still say “whasssssup” when we meet someone and why you rarely see “charlie bit my finger” anymore. It’s also the reason you need to be careful when you get in. Just like a real meme, if you get in early you’re quite funny and maybe a bit edgy, but sharing “this is bill” in 2021 is less likely to go down well.

Deep reinforcement learning
 Deep learning in general
 Computer vision (e.g., CNNs, Vision Transformers, object detection, segmentation, etc.)
 Evolutionary algorithms 
 Swarm intelligence
 Particle swarm optimization
 Neuroevolution
 
  
Do you have some recommendations about topics? What topics are the best for future jobs?

 I am doing a project at work to predict On time delivery percentage in a manufacturing process. I recently discovered Quantile Random Forest and I like the idea of it. I am thinking of using Quantile 0.5 as a point estimator and 0.1 and 0.9 quantile as prediction interval.
 So far the results have been good but since I&#39;m new to the real world project setting and new to quantile random forest, I was wondering is there something I should keep in mind while using this algorithm?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here&#39;s how to do it:
  
Prepare a safe second device, like an old phone (or a new one of course)
 Open Google Authenticator on your main device
 Tap the three dots in the upper right-hand corner of the screen
 Tap transfer
 Tap export
 Tap next
  
This shows a QR which you can then Import on another device with Google Authenticator. You cannot screenshot it on Android.
 Do this before you lose your phone or before it goes tits up. Going through the 2FA recovery process without a backup is HELL ON EARTH.…]]></summary>

 For those not in the know today is the expiration date for $2.2 Billion in options. They usually fluctuate price but due to the recent crash and fear in the market at high levels it&#39;s a recipe for disaster 
 Currently we are facing strong selling at $37,000.00 and a base of $36,500.00 
 A major cross of either can mean a swing to the upside towards $41,500.00 or a bottom of $19,000.00

I.e. to farm this coin, one must allot dedicated hard drives and allot the space (known as plots), and get rewarded for it. Sounds good on paper, and one could even be tempted to think they may put that spare 500 GB space left and earn some passive income on it. 
 Except, this one already requires industrial grade storage space, just to farm a token that has almost zero adoption anywhere.

I can&#39;t find any AI/ML job openings at their career site - only software engineers and .. Flight Controls Lead. I wonder if it is similar to Boston Dynamics in their limited use of AI and focusing on complex physics models instead. 
 The showcase video looks impressive.

 I work for a large wholesale company, and I am trying to create a way to forecast when specific items will go out of stock at a specific store. I have access to sales data by store-item for the past 5 years as well the past 5 years of out of stock data (also on a store-item level). 
 How would you approach this? 
 FYI I code in Python mainly, and I&#39;m pretty familiar with most ML tools and models. 
 Just trying to get a variety of ideas. 
 Thank you.

 Is it feasible to try and compress the length to 2 or 3 dimensions so that I might visualize what any of the above methods have accomplished? If it it feasible than can I get pointed in the right direction for python libraries, packages, etc? Does not need to be perfect... just needs to give more than a csv file lol.

A sub where all (most) coins can be discussed and not be called shitcoins right away (most of the time) will flip the sub where mentioning eth will get you insta banned. 
 I welcome this change in the hierarchy.
 All coins are equal but some are more equal than others.

Right now the plan is to basically treat all of this as an extended cycle all the way to 2024, which is the next cycle start. All I&#39;m doing is just chilling, accumulating, DCA-ing. If I&#39;m not at my goal, I&#39;m not selling. 
 Weirdly enough, having this commitment has made it easier for me to sleep. I barely check charts anymore. 
 Checking every few hours counts as &quot;barely&quot;, right?

 Is there any substitute that does a better job than Knime and this is the reason why it is not very popular.
 Any opinion is helpful.

 From Qiao Wang&#39;s twitter;
  
3 dumb things happened within the last hour: 
 1-Reuters writing a misleading article on China banning 
 2-People retweeting Reuters and believing it 
 3-Market dumping on the Reuters news 
 China didn&#39;t just ban crypto. It&#39;s reiterating an anti-speculation law from years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A crypto chart is nothing more than a picture of human emotions. Painted on the canvas are the emotions of greed, fear, hope, and euphoria. As a disciplined trader, you capitalize on the psychological demons that plague other traders.
 Simply HODL. Longterm strategies are best to beat algorithm and high frequency traders. Invest money you can afford to lose or not have access to for a few years. Weekly ups and downs don’t matter anymore. And then you can stop looking at the chart entirely.

 I work for a fairly small to mid-sized firm, and we&#39;re facing some growing challenges as a data team. Our leadership/management team currently respects teams that add value to the company, so our marketing team tends to receive significant recognition.
 Other teams tend to take credit for the reports, models, and any other analysis we do. This lends to our team apparently not adding business value to the company and makes it more difficult to do salary raises, promotions, hiring, etc. Another i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most anomaly detection techniques/packages focus on anomaly detection within a single time series; ie, take some sort of steady-state average and alert if the data suddenly goes above or below some threshold. My problem is totally different, however.
 I have a hardware device that performs the same operation repeatedly. Most of the time it succeeds, but sometimes it fails. I have sensors that measure position and angle (6DOF), and I have a large data set of each attempt, whether or not it was a success or f…]]></summary>

I&#39;ve really worked at some smaller startups where a senior data scientist would supervise and give advice. I recently got a job offer at a much bigger company so I&#39;m curious about whether or not is normal for larger companies to have more organized training opportunities. Thank you!

One single click, which can be initiated by anyone with a free account and access to internet is worth almost 5 cents. This is higher than the minimum hourly wage in some countries. Sierra Leone for example has a minimum wage of 3 cents. It really puts things in perspective for me when you think of it that way.

And though we both agreed that A.I might replace us soon, I&#39;d like to see some reasons from you guys here as of why A.I can&#39;t replace us (for a different perspective). I&#39;m still wondering if we humans can overcome the rise of A.I and the likelihood of them taking over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I&#39;ve got a relatively big dataset (8 GB) and pandas crashes when trying to load it into a dataframe. I&#39;ve tried modin and pyspark, all with no luck. Are there any Python packages that can work with big data? Currently the data is stored in SQL.
 I&#39;m running this on a company VM which has 16GB RAM I believe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I&#39;m new and working on a logistic regression model. I have two variables that are (what I would consider) abnormally large at 10.2 and 30.7. I read online that it&#39;s usually a bad sign if this is the case and that this may signal multicollinearity. However, the VIF Factor on these is 1.2 (for both) under the 5.0 that I&#39;ve read signals multicollinearity. Is it OK to leave these in? Should I remove them? Thanks.

 When you compare the energy usage per transaction bitcoins real problem is shown.
 1 Bitcoin transaction uses 910 kWh 100,000 Visa transactions use 149 kWh

 I am looking for pointers on how/where to start the use case of ranking associates. For example, there is a class of 10 students who gave exams for last 3 years and we have the marks in those tests. Now can I use the historical marks for each subject and predict the future marks and rank the associates accordingly. Also can I give suggestions to students on where to improve to get a better rank/marks ?

 When the leadership team tests the tool they pick a few cases they think they know and gauge results that way. I think this cherry picking will lead to problematic decisions. Are there better ways to test search engine results then large test sets?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently reading about Cardano on other subreddits and the sentiment is not as jubilant as when cardano is mentioned in this sub. 
 Often when talking about Cardano a comparison is drawn to Tezos and how Tezos is way ahead of Cardano.
 Which got me thinking, why don’t we talk more about Tezos here? How come we hear so much about Cardano instead?

One thing that I&#39;ve found valuable that takes just a few seconds is clicking on people&#39;s usernames and looking at their recent post history. A potential red flag for me is that they constantly talk about one coin, or all their recent posts are in that coin&#39;s subreddit.
 Another thing I sometimes find is subtle brigading. All of a sudden, five posts in one thread talking about a certain coin, and all five post…]]></summary>

 However this growth isn&#39;t entirely surprising going by the Bitcoin cycle - the Bitcoin halving event has instigated a bull market on three occasions now.

 I had 11336 Doge with an initial investment of $876. I then sold it all for $5706.66, a 6x ROI, and roughly $4830 in net profit (not taking into account taxes).
