 Hi, I used a feed forward neural network on Keras to approximate a concave one dimensional function , I would like to find the argmax and the max of my neural network, what would be the easiest way to solve this ?

Or worse, you find someone else (even though less capable technically) making the decisions and telling you how the project should be handled.

 I&#39;m building a tool that asks personalized follow up questions in order to get detailed survey responses. It&#39;s powered in part by GPT-3 (created by OpenAI). If you&#39;re open to testing it, it takes a couple of minutes...and I welcome feedback.
 It&#39;s imperfect, but that&#39;s why we&#39;re testing ;) Please DM me for a link!
 I&#39;d also love to hear your experiences building standalone AI products like this.

In Descent of Woman, published in 1972, she asked her readers to take science into their own hands. “Try a bit of fieldwork,” she suggested. “Go out of your front door and try to spot some live specimens of Homo sapiens in his natural habitat. It shouldn’t be difficult because the species is protected by law and in no immediate danger of extinction.” After completing observations of 20 random people, she suggested, substitute them when you are reading statements about universal human…]]></summary>

Later the early United States was a lab for observing this as its settlers altered nature. By 1800 it was known that the mass clearing of forests raised temperatures in the Eastern U.S. and that climatic changes followed the pioneers as they spread west.
