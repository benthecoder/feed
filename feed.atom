It&#39;s easy to get swept up in the panic when everyone is talking about how the bear market is here, coins are going lower, etc. &quot;Next stop btc 20k! Eth $600!&quot; As soon as we get green candles again, it&#39;s all forgotten. 
 Don&#39;t put yourself through the mood swings. Get off reddit, go down to the pub and wait for it all to blow over.

 Is it feasible to try and compress the length to 2 or 3 dimensions so that I might visualize what any of the above methods have accomplished? If it it feasible than can I get pointed in the right direction for python libraries, packages, etc? Does not need to be perfect... just needs to give more than a csv file lol.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I could sell at a loss, but I&#39;m not going to. Right now the plan is to basically treat all of this as an extended cycle all the way to 2024, which is the next cycle start. All I&#39;m doing is just chilling, accumulating, DCA-ing. If I&#39;m not at my goal, I&#39;m not selling. 
 Weirdly enough, having this commitment has made it easier for me to sleep. I barely check charts anymore. 
 Checking every few hours counts as &quot;barely&quot;, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys, I have a problem statement where there is a need for fire detection which is usually handled by Computer Vision Object Detection models - YOLO, Faster R-CNN, etc. However, I was thinking about using Multimodal DL for this to take inputs from heat/thermal sensor, etc. apart from video feeds.
 Any practical blog/tutorial you can point me to?
 Thanks!

 It seems like the ideal data scientist is an expert in all of those areas, even though in reality it’s quite difficult. We all sorta learn what we need depending on the problem we’re tryna solve
 Update: seems like most of y’all are recommending be a generalist unless I’m passionate about a specific area

 But here we are today, with so much blood in the streets, Doge stood its ground and is now the 3rd biggest crypto by marketcap. Still holding its incredible YTD ROI of more than 6000%.

 I&#39;m not a financial advisor - and I am not providing you financial advice. This is all my interpretation of what is going on.
 TL;DR: The market is an overleveraged and rehypothecated bomb.

 I currently work in finance/banking as a bank regulator. It requires a lot of financial analysis and familiarity with banking.

 I was scrolling feeds of the group and did a quick search for Knime. It actually surprises me how unpopular as a platform is considering that the last post was a year ago. 
 I have started to learn more about Knime (required for job) and wanted to see your thoughts on the platform based on the experience you had.
 Is there any substitute that does a better job than Knime and this is the reason why it is not very popular.
 Any opinion is helpful.

Researchers from Google recently published a paper where they got state-of-the-art results in panoptic segmentation (see below for intuitive explanation). They achieved it by combining information about depth, existing and new objects from two consequent frames.

Therefore, as as the price increases, in equilibrium so too does the power consumed by the network. Under Proof-of-Stake, when the price of ETH increases, the security of the network does too (the value of the ETH at-stake is worth more), but the energy requirements remain unchanged.

 I’m a Data Scientist working in Australia. I’m the sole DS in my company and all the other DS I know outside of there are at a similar level I am. I used to be in academia in a different field so I don’t have a more senior person to talk to.
 All this is to ask if you folks know of any mentoring networks that I could join.

One single click, which can be initiated by anyone with a free account and access to internet is worth almost 5 cents. This is higher than the minimum hourly wage in some countries. Sierra Leone for example has a minimum wage of 3 cents. It really puts things in perspective for me when you think of it that way.

 Think yourself: why should it be over?
 Grayscale, Microstrategy and PayPal are still buying, Tesla is searching for a integration of a power efficient cryptocurrency and almost all major banks are creating a crypto/Bitcoin fund. This is just a pullback like all others. We&#39;ll be back to $60k in 2 weeks - just zoom out :)
 Enjoy these &quot;dippy days&quot; and see it as a healthy correction as well as a great opportunity to buy more

 If you felt like it was a good investment a week ago, it&#39;s still a good investment now.
 The price of your holdings in the short term are mostly speculation.
 Over the long term, the price will revert to its fundamental value (i.e. what it&#39;s actually worth).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thoughts on ALGO? “All” chart on Coinmarketcap shows trades started in mid 2019th at ~$2 but it dumped to $0.30 3 months after, hovered around that price for most of the 2020 and then pumped in 2021 as everything else. 
 I see it mentioned a lot in daily, in a good way, so does anyone want to share any insights about this coin? Is its value increased cause its fundamentals are good or its increasing because, well, everything else is also pumping?

 I&#39;m new and working on a logistic regression model. I have two variables that are (what I would consider) abnormally large at 10.2 and 30.7. I read online that it&#39;s usually a bad sign if this is the case and that this may signal multicollinearity. However, the VIF Factor on these is 1.2 (for both) under the 5.0 that I&#39;ve read signals multicollinearity. Is it OK to leave these in? Should I remove them? Thanks.

 I&#39;ve been doing a lot of DataCamp courses on machine learning and they usually concern topics in the middle of the work flow. What I would like to research is how to set up a daily scheduled job and eventually export the results to .csv for example
 Basically how can I make predictions and share them with my superiors where they can see their reliability right away.
 Can you share some resources for such a setup?
 Thanks!

The universe bets on disorder. Imagine, for example, dropping a thimbleful of red dye into a swimming pool. All of those dye molecules are going to slowly spread throughout the water.
Physicists quantify this tendency to spread by counting the number of possible w…]]></summary>

I clicked open the link to a band who appeared to have journeyed from their mountain village in Russia to busk for tourists in the city square. Three women wore long white wedding dresses, thick strands of bead necklaces, and Cossack hats that towered from their heads like minarets of black wool. They pla…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his Theaetetus, Plato remarks to Socrates: “This pathos is proper to the philosopher: It is the thaumazein. And philosophy has no other point of departure than this.” The word, which contains the root thauma, the same that appears in thaumaturgy, has often been translated as “wonder.” Philosophy is born out of amazement mixed with the curiosity that arises from facing something inexplicable that fascinates and transcends us. Aristotle writes explicitly that, beginning by asking the simplest questions, hu…]]></summary>

Seahorses seem to have evolved not entirely in the ocean, but also by way of a whimsical storybook, in which animal body parts are all mixed up. A fish with the head of a horse? A male that gets pregnant, gives birth, and is monogamous?
Seahorses led her not only to her career as the head of marine and freshwater conservation at the London Zoological Society, but to her effo…]]></summary>
