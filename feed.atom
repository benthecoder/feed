I’m concerned because not only do I own a private wallet full of cash, including several $20 bills, but I’m the only person who knows where that wallet is most of the time. Do you think I should replace the back pocket of all my pants with a clear piece of plastic so my wallet is always visible? Seeking advice. Thanks

I was wondering if anyone had experience with how code reviews are done in practice for data teams who aren&#39;t necessarily building software products per se. Any thoughts on how beneficial they are/how they should be approached?

 They never had a problem with you swiping your card for $100K in chips at a casino, lose, then jump off the casino roof.... On Christmas.

This podcast is called AXRP, pronounced axe-urp and short for the AI X-risk Research Podcast. Here, I (Daniel Filan) have conversations with researchers about their papers. We discuss the paper and hopefully get a sense of why it’s been written and how it might reduce the risk of artificial intelligence causing an existential catastrophe: that is, permanently and drastically curtailing humanity’s future potential.

My idea for the beginning would be to offer Data Science as a service in the B2b area. However, I do not know yet where exactly I should start. Website is up and running, I already had orders on Fiverr, but mostly from students. If someone already has experience in this area, I would be happy if you could give some advice :)

 I have no intention to de-dollarize since the move would not bring any benefit.
 Bitcoin will be legal tender for all debts, including tax. Merchants must accept bitcoin for goods and services, unless they are technologically unable to. (So please upgrade your shit asap)

 I was going through my previous take home screening tasks (two to be precise lol), and realised I never really got a feedback for one of them. I remember doing a lot for it, at the time.
 If you are involved in hiring of some sorts, could you please give me some feedback on the work? I could dm the work to you.
 (Please let me know if this is not the correct place to post it. Judging by the rules, I think it is appropriate).
 Thank you.

Perhaps I&#39;ll also add some interactive visual plots or something of that sort.

 I might potentially get into a new working project involving NLP in a few months, so I&#39;m seeking to learn NLP in advance. I use Python so resources in Python would be great.
 I was thinking to take this course: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/natural-language-processing. It looks organized, comprehensive (in my very ignorant opinion) and is beginner friendly. In addition, it charges 27 AUD per month which is reasonable to me.
 Any advice is appreciated 🙂

 Personally I&#39;m bullish on Amptoken- I feel like it still has a long ways to go to prove itself but I could see it being big if Flexa takes off over the next year or 2. 
 The next two for me would be Algorand and Cardano from what I&#39;ve read on them and seeing how they&#39;ve been performing so far.

The amount of Algorand love here though has me wondering if it&#39;s not a project I&#39;ve overlooked and this could be early days with a lot more growth to come. What are the specific Algorand features or potential upsides that make it unique? I know you&#39;re not my real Crypto Dad but can you an argument for Algorand versus the alts I&#39;m into already? Thanks guys.

 As someone who is a beginner with just 1 year of experience, there&#39;s not a lot of big projects under my belt. And I was thinking of adding some adhoc tasks in my resume. For example: My manager would tell me to analyze why this week&#39;s cycle time for a factory increased.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, Well, recently I have started to look for data science jobs as I&#39;m feeling more confident about my skills. But!!! I saw a job offer that is really ironic: the employer wants a data scientist with 2 to 3 years of experience for an internship position. I mean, seriously?! What&#39;s wrong with some employers??!!! And That&#39;s the rant of the day
 Thank you all for reading Looking forward to reading your comments

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The war of deep learning frameworks is still on fire, and there are also a few open-source frameworks that have been developed and arisen from the community. 
 Does the new performance-centered deep Learning framework like OneFlow can be the next game-changer, or it&#39;s just a game for the top two? What is the final form of DL framework in the future?

I am rather new to crypto, and have been investing small amounts on a weekly basis. My plan is to reach 1k of extra savings over the next 2 months and then invest that larger sum. I have currently been buying ETH, ATOM and ADA. I look forward to hearing your choices!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I’ve found time series forecasting to be quite interesting, and I wanted to learn more. I am learning the basics of the math from a textbook, however I want to read some papers as well. What are some must read time series forecasting/analysis papers that every student who wants to study time series must read? What are the “classic” papers? One I’m planning to read soon is the prophet paper, but other than that I’m not sure. Suggestions would be great!

 Better yet, how would you anticipate and prevent such a situation from happening?

 I recently purchased AIMA to self-study but have found it difficult to remain motivated without anyone to discuss it with or to hold any way to hold myself accountable.

In collaboration with Michigan State University (MSU), Facebook has presented a research method of detecting and attributing Deepfakes based on reverse engineering from a single AI-generated image to the generative model used to produce the image.

 What does it take to do this in a budget friendly way? (no vendor lock-ins or proprietary software licenses as much as possible) 
 It has to have automated, scheduled replication (using CDC/bin log).
 Alternatively, can you suggest an easy to manage olap dwh other than clickhouse?

 Additionally, I read that there &quot;aren&#39;t many good formal educational opportunities to learn data science. &quot; Is that still true? 
 Lastly, would people in Japan be interested in data science presentations by speakers from Canada and/or the states?

 Wagers on 28k? Lol
 Not too good with this crystal ball stuff. However, I am still DCA in a few coins so with my luck we will see 10k...
 Jokes aside though rough few weeks, but guess it&#39;s best to think of it as a chance to buy with each drop.
 Random thought: why are these called dips when it is just a down trend? Seems a bit silly to say but the dip in cases like these. Maybe wi…]]></summary>

 How would you approach this? Retrain a really basic model 40k times? Or have a huge model that is trained once with all the data?
 How fast would the prediction work? I mean if it takes 10 seconds for each of the time series, 400k seconds is... a few days :(

 I&#39;m working on a project with a client that has sensitive data. He would like me to do the analysis on the data without it being downloaded to my computer. The data needs to stay private.

 I have a dataset containing the monthly number of shipments for the years 2014 to 2019. I used the Facebook Prophet algorithm to fit a basic model. However, I am not sure how to implement cross-validation on this data. I could not find any blogs/GitHub files that perform cross-validation on monthly data. Is there a workaround for this?
 Thanks in advance

 As far as I understand, we can evaluate the outputs of all trees at once (hence parallelizable), and the final prediction is just a linear combination. Is that correct?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not really a big fan of Warren Buffett, but I think this quote describes perfectly how wealth is accumulated....and it&#39;s why everyone is here. No offense to the traders here, but the goal isn&#39;t to be sitting in front of screens making the right timing decisions...it&#39;s to be letting assets you own accumulate. So congrats for being here and starting on that path...

(What he actually said, in his 1936 work “Physics and Reality,” is more longwinded, and includes a digression into Immanuel Kant and the meaning of “comprehensibility”, but he does write “... the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.”) In truth, this statement holds back a little.

It turns out that many people—even some in my progressive, liberal bubble—resist the idea of men becoming feminist dads because they think feminism is inherently “emasculating.” They mistakenly imagine that the move toward gender equality requires a devaluation of manhood.

We&#39;ll be driven by our customers.&quot; Barra claims that GM is trying to &quot;simplify&quot; its customers&#39; shopping experience and ownership.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Title says most of it. 
 Whenever things start to dip, I see a lot of people around here post the phrase &quot;buy the dip&quot;. They&#39;re right, it&#39;s a great buying opportunity. 
 Always keep in mind though, it&#39;s possible for the dip to dip, and you&#39;ll want to have some fiat leftover incase that happens.
 TLDR: Buy the dip, but have money leftover incase the dip dips.

 However, today I was finally able to acquire a total of 1 ETH through multiple smaller buys since last October. I’m quite proud.

 Hi, I used a feed forward neural network on Keras to approximate a concave one dimensional function , I would like to find the argmax and the max of my neural network, what would be the easiest way to solve this ? Should I implement something myself or does Keras already have some buil in function for that ?
 Thanks!
