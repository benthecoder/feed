 The only negative I&#39;ve heard is it has inflationary tokenomics.
 Am I missing something as to why it isn&#39;t very popular? Please try to answer with only factual, not emotional or biased, responses.
 Thank you!

 It&#39;s imperfect, but that&#39;s why we&#39;re testing ;) Please DM me for a link!
 I&#39;d also love to hear your experiences building standalone AI products like this.
