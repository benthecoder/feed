 Should I get M1 Mac Air or a windows?
 I will be using VM for cybersec stuff often and need some minimal gpu for testing ml models from what I&#39;ve seen &amp; heard from research. Also need good memory? The big ML stuff will be done in cloud cuz laptops can&#39;t handle it from what ive heard.

 I just wanted to make this post to simply share my experience (and also get your perspective/input) using different coding languages, namely python and R, to perform data analysis. I am by no means any expert; just a simple user who is completely in awe with this field.
 I have only recently started to code in R (2 months now) and ever since, I cannot help but love it. I only started learn to code since last year and like many, I started off with python because the ML project I was working on last …]]></summary>

The 2 contractors mentioned, Leidos and Progeny, should be able to deliver a good product, and if it&#39;s implemented well, the risk for casualties and errors should be reduced drastically, and not just for the US.

 &#x200B;
 For example if I have sales data, what to look at? What business questions to ask? How to make compelling business recommendation from my findings etc.
 &#x200B;
 Do you know of any online resource/course/book/video on that matter?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[XLM, a decentralized cryptocurrency with fees so low you can send 1000 transactions, costing a cent. Along with its supply cap of 50 billion, meaning more cannot just be “printed”. Yes, I get there are competitors like NANO, but even then I still don’t see it widespread. Some people may say that this is a stable coin in some instances, and well, it’s both a good and bad thing. You can hold XLM without much worry about it crashing a ton overnight, but it still has its volatility.

 Additionally, I read that there &quot;aren&#39;t many good formal educational opportunities to learn data science. &quot; Is that still true? 
 Lastly, would people in Japan be interested in data science presentations by speakers from Canada and/or the states?

 If you put money in crypto and you now can’t afford something you need, you put more into the market than you should have. That was a bad choice, but you can’t change the past. Instead, put your control in your future.

 How would you approach this? Retrain a really basic model 40k times? Or have a huge model that is trained once with all the data?
 How fast would the prediction work? I mean if it takes 10 seconds for each of the time series, 400k seconds is... a few days :(

 I’ve been buying the dip and I bought a bunch of ethereum today at $1900, doubled my position. I’m very careful though in case it does dip lower.

With each ban there was naturally less and less effect on the actual market. But it looks like recently the Chinese went all out with their crypto ban hammer on all levels (so conveniently coinciding with the final stages of the Digital Yuan launch).
 For a long time, Chinese controlling Bitcoin and it&#39;s hashrate, was a leading FUD of the opponents of Bitcoin in general. Well…]]></summary>

 Youtube
 Facebook
 Wikipedia
 Reddit
 Netflix
 Instagram
 Whatsapp
 Skype
 Quora
 Winnie the Pooh
 Alice in Wonderland
 Even though these things are banned in China, they are thriving in the rest of the world.
 If China wants to crackdown Bitcoin mining activities, miners will go elsewhere. This is actually a good thing for cryptocurrencies, as it shouldn’t be under a decentralised, power-obsessed regime. China can play with its digital yuan.

 I have a dataset containing the monthly number of shipments for the years 2014 to 2019. I used the Facebook Prophet algorithm to fit a basic model. However, I am not sure how to implement cross-validation on this data. I could not find any blogs/GitHub files that perform cross-validation on monthly data. Is there a workaround for this?
 Thanks in advance

 As far as I understand, we can evaluate the outputs of all trees at once (hence parallelizable), and the final prediction is just a linear combination. Is that correct?

 MC2 is a project that aims at helping data scientists and engineers collaborate and process collective data without sharing the content of the data with one another, not even the cloud provider. I think the project is very interesting and I&#39;d like about the use cases and what you will do with it.

But there are still things I don’t know. I was wondering if there was someone who wouldn’t mind being friends on discord or something where I can ask questions when they pop in my head. For the most part, I think Google answers the base line of my questions, but it would be nice to be able to tailor my question based on my role.

 This is how I make extra money while I am at my job and invest that money into coins that make money.
 I work a job that pretty much requires me to just be there. Every once in a while I have to deal with a customer, but for the most part I’m just there on my phone making sure that people don’t steal and help customers out when I can.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All!
 Could I get your opinions on the best value data science bootcamps out there? It&#39;s something I&#39;ve looked at for a long time, but I&#39;ve been hesitant to pick one because there seems to be so many of them.
 The first one that comes to mind is General Assembly, and I also see Springboard. Let me know your experience with these and any others out there.
 Thanks in advance!

I currently have little to no knowledge on cloud platforms and I am wanting to learn more. As a first step I’m planning to prepare for the basic certification offered by AWS I.e. Cloud Practitioner. It would be great if anyone can provide me resources to begin with. I’m more of a video person than book person so if you have any online MOOC course that will be perfect for my goal. Thanks!

No offense to the traders here, but the goal isn&#39;t to be sitting in front of screens making the right timing decisions...it&#39;s to be letting assets you own accumulate. So congrats for being here and starting on that path...

Just to give you a context on overestimation, sometimes he&#39;ll ask me to build a dashboard in a week but I end up developing in a day or two.

 Is the occupation of a Data Analyst part of occupation unit group 2172--Database Analysts and Data Administrators? If not, which occupational unit does it fall into in the Canadian National Occupational Classification System?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Too many people treat this like a casino or like the latest r/wallstreetbets stock play. Crypto is a long game. People that bought the peak in 2017 had to wait three years to break even, it&#39;s not always a quick process.
 Don&#39;t get me wrong, if you buy crypto you will make a significant amount of money, you just have to hold long enough. 5+ years should be your timeframe.
 Big gains in crypto require diamond balls and years of holding.

 I would be curious to hear how this problem is being handled across the industry.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Title says most of it. 
 Whenever things start to dip, I see a lot of people around here post the phrase &quot;buy the dip&quot;. They&#39;re right, it&#39;s a great buying opportunity. 
 Always keep in mind though, it&#39;s possible for the dip to dip, and you&#39;ll want to have some fiat leftover incase that happens.
 TLDR: Buy the dip, but have money leftover incase the dip dips.

 However, today I was finally able to acquire a total of 1 ETH through multiple smaller buys since last October. I’m quite proud.
 HODL and be good to one another!

 2) compile the data.
 3) organize companies by return over a 10 year period.

 For example, what % of companies end up being 10x or being removed.
 Thanks in advance. I haver zero skills related to this.

We use it for a ton of stuff at work and it&#39;s an area that I&#39;ve asked Andrew about a million times, so he wrote this blog post, probably to stop me from bugging him. Hope you find it useful!

 I&#39;m building a tool that asks personalized follow up questions in order to get detailed survey responses. It&#39;s powered in part by GPT-3 (created by OpenAI). If you&#39;re open to testing it, it takes a couple of minutes...and I welcome feedback.
 It&#39;s imperfect, but that&#39;s why we&#39;re testing ;) Please DM me for a link!
 I&#39;d also love to hear your experiences building standalone AI products like this.
