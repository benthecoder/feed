However, the data science program has a focus in genomics (I love the field), but will this limit my ability to work in other fields of data science? Also, how beneficial are internships in this field? I am new to this so I would appreciate all the help that I can get. Thank you!

 I might potentially get into a new working project involving NLP in a few months, so I&#39;m seeking to learn NLP in advance. I use Python so resources in Python would be great.
 I was thinking to take this course: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/natural-language-processing. It looks organized, comprehensive (in my very ignorant opinion) and is beginner friendly. In addition, it charges 27 AUD per month which is reasonable to me.
 Any advice is appreciated 🙂

 You are trying to get a model to determine the best values for seven variables. The only thing is that the first variable determines if the next three variables have an impact on the result (the state of the three have no impact) or the last three variables.

Usually we would expect a variance much greater than 2.5%. This just makes the PCA useless. Do I need to take a look at my previous steps? What can this imply statistically?

 This really shows how much pull the reddit name has. I think this means very good things for the reddit coins like r/cc moons moving forward.
 Hopefully reddit will also start paying more attention to crypto/NFTs moving forward, seeing the success of the first batch of CryptoSnoos.

Some seemed legit, but some after DMing them I got a few very similar copy paste responses, almost down the exact wording.

 Lifelines, Convoys, and Scikit-survival do a good job of showing how to draw survival curves in Python, but they focus exclusively on Matplotlib, sometimes to the point of hard-coding Matplotlib-based convenience functions.
 This tutorial shows how to draw survival curves with Altair and Plotly (Python) based on a Lifelines Kaplan-Meier model.

I am learning the basics of the math from a textbook, however I want to read some papers as well. What are some must read time series forecasting/analysis papers that every student who wants to study time series must read? What are the “classic” papers? One I’m planning to read soon is the prophet paper, but other than that I’m not sure. Suggestions would be great!

 I&#39;m a fan of kaggle competitions with python and machine learning, but I can&#39;t find interesting projects to upgrade my cv and practice with sql and pyspark. Apparently I&#39;ll be working mainly on cloud/databricks. Any ideas or suggestions of fun projects or books?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most people will only go buy Bitcoin when it’s hyped, rather to buy it when the price is good. (Same reason when people didn’t buy BTC at 500 dollars in 2014, and skipped the chance to buy it at 9,000 dollars in 2018.) Will you regret today’s 30k? Yes you will... You will come to this same sub after 5 years and question yourself on why you didn&#39;t buy 5 years ago.
 The cycle repeats.

 I recently purchased AIMA to self-study but have found it difficult to remain motivated without anyone to discuss it with or to hold any way to hold myself accountable. I was wondering if there was anybody in a similar situation, or even anybody that wants to start reading it, that would also find it beneficial to pair up virtually or go through the textbook together?

In collaboration with Michigan State University (MSU), Facebook has presented a research method of detecting and attributing Deepfakes based on reverse engineering from a single AI-generated image to the generative model used to produce the image.

 I think using statistical programs would help me create graphics for people to look at. It can even help me understand research better. 
 What would you suggest is a statistical program for what I am looking for?

 All you need to do is create a capital loss. This means you sell crypto for a lower price than you bought it at. For example: If you bought one bitcoin at 60k, and you sell at 30k, you just locked in a capital loss of 30k.
 So why is this important? Because capital losses cancel out capital gains. Since the wash sale rule doesn&#39;t apply, you can instantly buy back your crypto and the l…]]></summary>

You can hold XLM without much worry about it crashing a ton overnight, but it still has its volatility.

 What does it take to do this in a budget friendly way? (no vendor lock-ins or proprietary software licenses as much as possible) 
 It has to have automated, scheduled replication (using CDC/bin log).
 Alternatively, can you suggest an easy to manage olap dwh other than clickhouse?

 I saw from this post (two years old) that robotics, NLP, and AR/VR were quite big in Japan. I was wondering if that is still the case? What other additional data science/AI fields are picking up over there? 
 Additionally, I read that there &quot;aren&#39;t many good formal educational opportunities to learn data science. &quot; Is that still true? 
 Lastly, would people in Japan be interested in data science presentations by speakers from Canada and/or the states? 
 Thank you for your time!

 If my company transitioned to Spark, what would be the impact for me? I would have faster processing times for my SQL and Python Scripts? Access to real time data, rather than waiting on ETLs?

 Not too good with this crystal ball stuff. However, I am still DCA in a few coins so with my luck we will see 10k...
 Jokes aside though rough few weeks, but guess it&#39;s best to think of it as a chance to buy with each drop.

 How would you approach this? Retrain a really basic model 40k times? Or have a huge model that is trained once with all the data?
 How fast would the prediction work? I mean if it takes 10 seconds for each of the time series, 400k seconds is... a few days :(

 I&#39;m working on a project with a client that has sensitive data. He would like me to do the analysis on the data without it being downloaded to my computer. The data needs to stay private.

These grads have to apply to an area of the business to work. I need to write a pitch to get these new grads to apply to my area of the business.
 Question is, if you are new to analytics/data science, why did you want to get into it? What did you hear about it for you to think yeah that’s what I want to do?

 I have a dataset containing the monthly number of shipments for the years 2014 to 2019. I used the Facebook Prophet algorithm to fit a basic model. However, I am not sure how to implement cross-validation on this data. I could not find any blogs/GitHub files that perform cross-validation on monthly data. Is there a workaround for this?
 Thanks in advance

 As far as I understand, we can evaluate the outputs of all trees at once (hence parallelizable), and the final prediction is just a linear combination. Is that correct?

No offense to the traders here, but the goal isn&#39;t to be sitting in front of screens making the right timing decisions...it&#39;s to be letting assets you own accumulate. So congrats for being here and starting on that path...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Title says most of it. 
 Whenever things start to dip, I see a lot of people around here post the phrase &quot;buy the dip&quot;. They&#39;re right, it&#39;s a great buying opportunity. 
 Always keep in mind though, it&#39;s possible for the dip to dip, and you&#39;ll want to have some fiat leftover incase that happens.
 TLDR: Buy the dip, but have money leftover incase the dip dips.

 What is a dusting attack?

A dusting attack is an attack in which a trace amount of crypto, called dust, is sent to thousands — sometimes even hundreds of thousands — of wallet addresses. This attack is deployed in order to track these addresses with the hope of “un-masking” or de…]]></summary>

 This is quite surprising since it&#39;s a subreddit based on cryptocurrency and it&#39;s opportunities. 
 It&#39;s free cryptocurrency that can actually change your life. One may even call it a low cap gem. Why miss out? Go and set up your vaults!

 I find it’s extremely useful if I have to perform matrix multiplication of matrices which is of higher dimension, it gives a great flexibility to sum and multiply among certain axis.
 Ex : if you have to multiply matrix A of shape (1,200,2,32) &amp; matrix B of shape (2,32,32) and results in a matrix C of shape (1,200,32).
 This can be implemented as follows:

 My co-worker u/andrewdoss_bitdotio just released a blog post showing an application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to NFL Combine data. We use it for a ton of stuff at work and it&#39;s an area that I&#39;ve asked Andrew about a million times, so he wrote this blog post, probably to stop me from bugging him. Hope you find it useful!
 Here is the article - all credit to Andrew.

 I&#39;m building a tool that asks personalized follow up questions in order to get detailed survey responses. It&#39;s powered in part by GPT-3 (created by OpenAI). If you&#39;re open to testing it, it takes a couple of minutes...and I welcome feedback.
 It&#39;s imperfect, but that&#39;s why we&#39;re testing ;) Please DM me for a link!
 I&#39;d also love to hear your experiences building standalone AI products like this.
