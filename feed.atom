        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A research team from DeepMind and Onshape combines a general-purpose language modelling technique and an off-the-shelf data serialization protocol to propose a machine learning model that can automatically generate high-quality sketches for Computer-Aided Design.
 Here is a quick read: DeepMind &amp; Onshape Leverage Transformers to Advance Automatic Computer-Aided Design.
 The paper Computer-Aided Design as Language is on arXiv.
