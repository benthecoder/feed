          "description": "Google researcher’s new study suggests modifying the conventional transformer architecture to process byte sequences in natural language processing (NLP). The new competitive byte-level models can effectively balance computational cost trade-offs of contemporary large language models.\n Tokenization splits the sentences into a sequence of tokens. Most NLP tasks follow a tokenization procedure to preprocess the data. However, tokenization can struggle with typos, irregularities in spelling and capitalization,…",
