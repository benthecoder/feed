The new competitive byte-level models can effectively balance computational cost trade-offs of contemporary large language models.\n Tokenization splits the sentences into a sequence of tokens. Most NLP tasks follow a tokenization procedure to preprocess the data. However, tokenization can struggle with typos, irregularities in spelling and capitalization,…",
