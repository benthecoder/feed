 This is tricky, mostly because traders may be exchangeable but trades are not.

That&#39;s bad because there may just be aggressiv…</p>

                <p>Hi.
 &#x200B;
 In a few weeks I&#39;ll join a data science team in which I&#39;ll be tasked with creating (presumably) web dashboards. To get a head start, I though I&#39;d reach out to the data science community to learn more about recommended technologies and tools for creating functional dashboards quickly. I don&#39;t yet know which functional requirements I&#39;ll be met with, so I just need to get some broad overview over the different options out there. 
 My background is in IT, and I&#39;ve worked w…</p>

                <p>Hi everyone, I compiled a list of newsletters for DS, DE, ML, and AI in this article and was wondering if you all agree with the list, or there&#39;s any other ones I missed out. Cheers.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>I&#39;m new to data science, and trying to keep myself interested in learning by being hands on with the project. I&#39;m trying to run a model and I believe good inputs would include proximity to parks and other land use cases. How can I obtain this data/extract this data from somewhere into a csv file? I know OSM seems to be the biggest free provider of this.
 Thanks!

                <p>Hey guys, I have a few options/offers for working at a few companies as a data scientist. I have the option for working for Deloitte (big 4 consulting firm) as a consultant, vs working at New York Times as a data scientist. I&#39;ve read information about both of these places but I would like to get the opinion of those on this subreddit w/o introducing any personal bias. Compensation difference between the two offers is negligible

 If you fully believe in crypto and are planning on holding for the future, I suggest you stake/lend to gain passive income on the assets you were going to hold anyways. 
 Making around $375 a week staking ETH, making money for doing absolutely nothing. Income fluctuates with price since you get paid in the crypto of choice, I was making ~$750/week a month ago.
 Honestly so satisfying getting paid every Saturday night.

 If i deploy a coin on BSC with 100m supply and burn 50% of it as soon as it’s deployed, and own 10m of it myself, my wallet will be listed as having 10% of the supply while i have actually 20% of it, since BSC…</p>

 run a list of uncorrelated features like: only feature A, then only feature B ... with a that model and doesn&#39;t change any param.

 I have no intention to de-dollarize since the move would not bring any benefit.
 Bitcoin will be legal tender for all debts, including tax. Merchants must accept bitcoin for goods and services, unless they are technologically unable to. (So please upgrade your shit asap)

 They CAN be used for these things, but what they really are is much simpler.
 Smart contracts are immutable scripts that exist on the blockchain. They maintain a state (i.e. they store data) and they have functions that can be called. That&#39;s it.

Smart contracts are the completion of the Bitcoin idea. Without smart contracts, Bitcoin is incomplete, because it is a decentralized coin, surrounded by a centralized economy. It misses its own point.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>I feel like a lot of people know a lot of the fundamentals of Blockchain and Bitcoin technology, and even more so of practical use of Ethereum, Matic, stellar, etc. But they don&#39;t know the basics of smart Contracts! So here!
 Smart Contracts make sure that when using pay to pay applications you can ensure that both people will be paid.

                <p>Many blockchains are implementing pretty awesome features using smart contracts. Multisig, custom tokens, exchanges, anchored currencies (wBTC/Tether/USDC) and more. These are great, but in practice they do currently have some downsides for day-to-day use - there can be issues with unpredictable gas prices and contract security.
 I find that one thing Stellar excels in is implementing useful features like those mentioned above as native features of the protocol. So for those who don&#39;t know, here are som…</p>

This podcast is called AXRP, pronounced axe-urp and short for the AI X-risk Research Podcast. Here, I (Daniel Filan) have conversations with researchers about their papers. We discuss the paper and hopefully get a sense of why it’s been written and how it might reduce the risk of artificial intelligence causing an existential catastrophe: that is, permanently and drastically curtailing humanity’s future potential.

                <p>Hello,
 A bit of background: I&#39;ve worked my way through a number of data-based roles over the past 8 years and I&#39;ve found myself recently as the manager of a small analytics engineering team. The team is currently a mix of technical analysts (BI tool / SQL experts) and junior data engineers. The company I work for had traditionally placed little value in data engineering and, as a result, I&#39;ve seen a number of data science projects start and fail very quickly for the same reason: poor data manag…</p>

                <p>Hello peeps!
 My work requires me to find the columns that are same (data-wise) but could have different aliases across tables.
 I manually lookout for similar sounding column names, a few basic attributes like dataTypes, basic arithmetic stats, etc. to find potentially matching columns.
 I want to take this a notch up by finding the matches using clustering.
 Desired Output: clusters of columns that are probably same (highly possible the biggest cluster in my output would be 2-5 attribute clusters)
 So fro…</p>

                <p>Humans are pattern-seeking animals. We are the best animal on earth at being able to identify patterns. This works both to our advantage and to our detriment. While we&#39;ll see patterns correctly most of the time, we will also identify patters that are non-existent or manufactured.
 For example, earlier this year DOGE pumped from 1 cent to 8 cents on a tweet from Elon Musk on the subject. Let&#39;s say that I&#39;m a friend of Elon and I ask him to tweet about DOGE at a specific time. All our friends have…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Seriously, USDT wants like 9 bucks for a transfer? Lots of different coins take forever and have high transaction fees. Swapping to Stellar Lumens and then transfering between exchanges is insanely fast and costs something ridiculous like 0.0001 lumens.
 Maybe in time all coins will have low tx fees, but for now, XLM deserves a round of applause from all of us for saving our asses again and again. Especially in countries where the on-ramp for fiat to exchanges is a pain in the ass.

                <p>The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that&#39;s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.
  
In one of the first lines of the first post by Satoshi, he (she? they?) names one of their primary reasons for creating Bitcoin and starting the cryptocurrency space. Following the financial crisis around 2008, central banks largely “printed” extra money, debasing everyone’s cash…</p>

                <p>I rent apartment for tourists during summer time. Today a couple came and didn&#39;t have enough cash. I told them they can pay in crypto if they wanted to instead of going to ATM to get more cash and in a sec the guy was thrilled. I gave him my adress, he scanned the QR code and BTC was in my wallet in 15 min. I won&#39;t exchange it. I&#39;ll just wait for it to be worth much more.
 I love crypto

                <p>Remember to spend time with your family and friends instead of looking at crypto charts every 5 minutes. There more to life than money and we often forget why we wanted it in the first place. To spend time in a meaningful way with our loved ones. You can always get more money, but you can never get more time.

 On-chain governance: Tezos is the blockchain with the most successful on-chain governance in crypto and no other chain really comes close.

                <p>Hi there :)
 I might potentially get into a new working project involving NLP in a few months, so I&#39;m seeking to learn NLP in advance. I use Python so resources in Python would be great.
 I was thinking to take this course: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/natural-language-processing. It looks organized, comprehensive (in my very ignorant opinion) and is beginner friendly. In addition, it charges 27 AUD per month which is reasonable to me.
 Any advice is appreciated 🙂

 For example, I use Coinbase pro to purchase assets and there is a waiting period from the time I deposit my fiat, to the time I can move my new assets to my wallet. When I purchase a coin I want to stake immediately li…</p>

 This is all thanks to crypto! Why you may ask? Well, this is how my work goes. I go in and finish everything as soon as I can and then start looking at those charts. I look at them and I pray to them, ask the crypto gods not to make my portfolio bleed …</p>

              <summary>SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said a bitcoin ETF is overdue and argued that its prior rejections for such funds is a kind of double standard. The SEC should have approved a bitcoin ETF a long time ago, she said.</summary>

Hester Peirce is perplexed.
 For years, the Securities and Exchange Commission, of which Peirce is a member, has denied applications by the nation’s exchanges and financial firms to list securities that track the performance of popular digital currency bitcoin.

                <p>I&#39;ll back to job market at the end of the month. Looking around some JDs, I saw lots of them require to have a github account or (nice to have). I wonder if it&#39;s really important?
 I mean it&#39;s making sense when we&#39;re a student. But when we&#39;re working 40h / week and if we have a family/kids..., I&#39;m not sure where we can find the time for open source project.
 And it&#39;s taking lots of time to complete a good project (even it&#39;s just pd.read_file)

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>What I know?
 Firstly, Precision=TP/(TP+FP)=TP/(predicted yes)
 Recall=TP/(TP+FN)=TP/(actual yes)
 What book says?
  
A model that declares every record has high recall but low precision.
  
I understand that if predicted positive is high, precision will be low. But how will recall be high if predicted positive is high.
  
A model that assigns a positive class to every test record that matches one of the positive records in the training set has very high precision but low recall.

 I&#39;ve got a budget from my employer to build a data science everyday workhorse. The idea is to build something with consumer hardware, as this allows us to get a very powerful machine with little budget. Nothing production relevant will be running on this machine. Basically instead of us running things on our laptops, we&#39;d be using this machine.

                <p>It&#39;s almost a meme at this point to say that we are all early, but it&#39;s also very common to see people saying they wish they could have gotten in sooner.
 I&#39;m too late, I could have gotten BTC when it was only $1000!
 I&#39;m too late, I could have gotten ETH at $200!
 And so on. Even our beloved/reviled moons are susceptible. There is a post today lamenting how they could have gotten 46k moons a year ago for one post.

                <p>Retrospectively, the early days of moons were crazy. I wasn&#39;t around back then, but the moons-to-karma ration was really high, and there was no cap how much moons one could earn on a single post or in a single round. That means, a single post could earn you a ton of moons - which you could have sold for a ton of money if you held them for a few months!
 So I wondered: what&#39;s the most valuable post on this sub? I scraped the top 1,000 posts, added the karma ratios of each month (I use data by u/IHave…</p>

 But anyway, thanks to staking various cryptos, the passive income I&#39;m currently receiving from those staking rewards is actually exceeding the income I get from my main job, which I think is pretty incredible.
 Despite making my first crypto purchase in mid 2017, whenever I heard people in here mention the word &quot;staking&quot; I always felt as if that was something too technical for me …</p>

                <p>When I first got into crypto trading and investing back in January, I used RH for its simplicity and Economics (free). It wasn’t until I had several thousand $ worth of crypto in it when I learned of its crummy business practices and the fact I don’t actually own the crypto. The problem I faced was that the only way to get it out was to liquidate it into USD, and transfer it to my bank, and rebuy the crypto on an exchange. I knew this process would take up to 6 business days. I was worried that in that time…</p>

                <p>I wonder if it&#39;s possible for the mods to create an account here that we can send moons too that can be given to a charity of the sub&#39;s choice each month. 
 A few of us were discussing this a while ago, maybe even something like taking 5% of the 20% holding bonus and donating that monthly to charity (for people that opt in of course)
 Any ideas on this?

                <p>I am really curious - If every upvote counts as approx. 0.4 0.2 moons, then why aren&#39;t people creating bots that will automatically upvote their posts? This can literally generate free money and it doesn&#39;t seem to be that hard since there are dozens of sites offering mass upvoting/downvoting for a few dollars.

 Don&#39;t buy crypto on RH, don&#39;t buy the IPO, don&#39;t short it or buy puts. Just stay away from RH.

                <p>Hey guys quick question, after running my PCA, my first PC only has a variance percent of 2.5％ and in order to reach 80% I am going to need 142 PCs. Usually we would expect a variance much greater than 2.5%. This just makes the PCA useless. Do I need to take a look at my previous steps? What can this imply statistically?

Some say you need to know linear algebra and calculus very well, some say you need to know SQL, coding, and know how to use stats/ml packages such as sklearn and others.
 So, my question to working data scientists: what amount of math/stats are you actually using at your job? My assumption was that DS is 90% data gathering/cleaning and 10% actual modeling.

 I thought it would be helpful if people shared what type of method they ended up using in a real world setting and a rough idea of the time series problem type (eg. Consumer demand forecasting).

 I&#39;m looking to hear from other data scientists in the marketing field, especially if you have worked on a demand forecasting model, a media mix model, or both.
 &#x200B;
 Media mix models are meant to determine the effect of ad spend on sales - giving evidence for the causality from observational data by controlling for factors such as seasonality, promotions/discounts, competitor activity, etc.

 On the other hand - demand forecasting models, particularly for companies who…</p>

                <p>What cryptos are you feeling for the long term to potentially produce the most gains, simply for stacking up and holding?
 Personally I&#39;m bullish on Amptoken- I feel like it still has a long ways to go to prove itself but I could see it being big if Flexa takes off over the next year or 2. 
 The next two for me would be Algorand and Cardano from what I&#39;ve read on them and seeing how they&#39;ve been performing so far.

 Give me your reason why a small coin you own could be useful as well. 
 Not trying to shill coins or anything btw. Just want to educate myself on other coins and thought I should give an example.

In “All Eyes on Me,” a song from his new Netflix special Inside, the musician-comedian Bo Burnham pauses to ask, “You want to hear a funny story?” He tells us that, five years ago, he quit performing live because, while on stage, he’d experience severe panic attacks. He spent that time trying to improve himself mentally instead. “And you know what? I did,” Burnham …</p>

                <p>I posted on Blind recently that I was looking for something new and I got a few responses saying they would refer me to some big name tech companies (such as FAANG and FAANG adjacent.) Some seemed legit, but some after DMing them I got a few very similar copy paste responses, almost down the exact wording. It made me a bit skeptical and I was wondering if anyone here has ever gotten interviews via this method and how reliable it is.

 Lifelines, Convoys, and Scikit-survival do a good job of showing how to draw survival curves in Python, but they focus exclusively on Matplotlib, sometimes to the point of hard-coding Matplotlib-based convenience functions.
 This tutorial shows how to draw survival curves with Altair and Plotly (Python) based on a Lifelines Kaplan-Meier model.

                <p>Copilot, a new Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool that resides within the Visual Studio Code editor and autocompletes code snippets, has been released as a technical preview by GitHub and OpenAI.
 According to GitHub, Copilot does more than merely parrot back code it’s seen previously. It examines the code you’ve already written and creates new code that matches it, including once used functions. Automatically developing the code to import tweets, generate a scatterplot, or retrieve a Goodreads rating are ju…</p>

The true diversity and complexity of human evolution over the last few hundred millennia surpasses even the most unhinged imaginings we might have hazarded just a short generation ago. But greater clarity has left us with a messier and less elegant narrative. Our species’ status, it turns out, is “complicated.”

 Many people are under the erroneous impression that there are such things as atomic units of ‘coins’ that are moved from address to address and can therefore be tracked on the public chain. I think this mistake has its roots in language and analogy.

                <p>Right now AI research is blossoming, with all kinds of fantastic results being published every week.
 But does anyone worry that when AI tools become powerful enough, governments around the world will crack down on it heavily and essentially prevent the general public from using it? I&#39;m imagining a world where people are trading model weights on flash drives because AI models are essentially outlawed or classified. 
 Is this just science fiction, or should we be planning ahead for such a scenario?

Why not to use a free game engine to build an environment, generate loads of precisely labeled data and try to train a network on that? Afterwards, if the virtual environment is realistic looking enough, we could try transfer learning to pip up the model on real photos, or even use it right away.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>I have been experimenting with graph embeddings like node2vec and word2vec and I am curious as to why we use 128 dimensions? If we have a node with 10 features wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to just have 10 dimensions instead of 128?
 Trial by fire here... any input is appreciated.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>My boyfriend got into crypto around December of 2020, and he decided to put a large sum of his money in during the huuuuge run we had earlier in the year. His strategy was to put a few thousand in and watch the charts meticulously every few seconds. I even saw him swing trading and swapping coins, so I decided to learn everything I could about crypto and see if he was getting &quot;scammed.&quot; 
 I learned a lot. I watched him tell our friends to buy doge coin, saw him put lump sums into BTC and BITCOIN C…</p>

 I know it was done because of moon farming but we can vote to remove it?

I get it, you don&#39;t need to repost the same f* article 25 times a day because your first post or someone else post didn&#39;t earn you enough moons. Stop, it&#39;s really annoying for the people who sort by new who are trying to see new content.

 The protocol (lets say ShitSwap) launches with regular farms where everything seems to be fine, and accrues volume and TVL gradually, everyone is earning their income and the project earns people&#39;s trust and a community forms around this project. This is the precursor to the scam.

 Then let&#39;s rewind uptil a few days ago, the sentiment is COMPLETELY opposite. I&#39;m seeing people say &quot;crypto is done&quot; and that &quot;crypto is a scam&quot;, and posts like these being upvoted. People I&#39;ve never se…</p>

 The company I work for wants everyone to come back to office starting next month. It&#39;s sad to see a company that portrays itself progressive and sustainable wants the employees to not work remote.
 It&#39;s been bothering me to think what a waste of time it will be and stuff I&#39;ll have to do to alter my whole routine. The fact that I literally don&#39;t interact with anyone all day and just do my job is making me realize what an overkill it is to go to the office.

                <p>Hello All!
 I have a question regarding transaction matching algorithms. 
 I received a data-set and the records consist of one side of a two sided trade. The goal is to match each trade record with its correct counter-party based on a few categorical and continuous fields. 
 This is mostly a cold-start problem as no training set is provided. A small number (~10%) of trades can be matched-up just based on the counter-parties only having one transaction between each other. 
 Any ideas on what would be the be…</p>

 My boss ask me to make a codebook about a project we have been working on. The problem is that he wants to codify a question that reads like this &quot;Describe what you think about X in three words&quot;. Is there a way to pipeline this? I use R and Stata and doing this word by word does not seems useful or doable. 
 I hope I was clear in my question.

He is also promoting his own (unsuccesful, its more than 200 times smaller than Bitcoin) shitcoin and tries to harm the classic Bitcoin as much as possible. Download…</p>

                <p>The term &quot;Computer Consciousness&quot; has a better ring to it and is more accurate.

 Not to mention that this &quot;AI&quot; does more than what would be deemed &quot;intelligent&quot; as it can construct art, music, etc.
 It is more than intelligent; it is Consciousness.

                <p>In my opinion, apple fans who praise apple because iPhones have years of support while telling android users that android phones are not good because they only get 1-2 years of support is nothing but stupid. Lets take the idea of security for now and focus on apps. Apps can extend what a smart phone can do, and without apps they don&#39;t do much but text and call. Some iphone users talk like android is bad because phones on that side only get 1-2 years o support rather than 5+ years. Thats actually stupid …</p>

                <p>There are lots of posts, threads and comments about Binance.com getting banned in the UK and many are worried that all your crypto assets will get lost/stolen, after seeing mainstream media post hundreds of articles about the ban.
 Let’s clear this up.
 Binance.com is not going anywhere for UK users.
 The FCA notice means that Binance must stop offering regulated products to users in the Uk. Examples are like futures, options or leveraged trading.
 It does not mean your crypto assets. The FCA clearly indica…</p>

 The amount of steps required to use layer 2 solutions or things like TLM and WAX are just so damn high and everyone along the way takes a cut. 
 This isn&#39;t how crypto is supposed to be. Currently, instead of paying one central party, there&#39;s a dozen different parties all wanting a share.

But for a good 5 months or so I was giving her pretty constant updates, because good lord is the bull run exciting and I wanted to share it with someone.
 Anyway, just a funny thought I had.

 Crab market? Bear market? Bull market? Who knows, but the shorts seem bullish (for now).

                <p>The Chinese government&#39;s call to crack down on bitcoin mining and trading has triggered a phenomenon known as &quot;mining migration&quot; in the encryption circle.
 Texas in the United States is an ideal destination for miners, thanks to its abundant solar and wind resources, an unregulated market, and a political stance friendly to cryptocurrency.

                <p>Most people will only go buy Bitcoin when it’s hyped, rather to buy it when the price is good. (Same reason when people didn’t buy BTC at 500 dollars in 2014, and skipped the chance to buy it at 9,000 dollars in 2018.) Will you regret today’s 30k? Yes you will... You will come to this same sub after 5 years and question yourself on why you didn&#39;t buy 5 years ago.

So the question is, am I ever going to catch up? 
 Sometimes it feels like more and more things are just getting accumulated in my reading list. Is too much curiosity…</p>

 I recently purchased AIMA to self-study but have found it difficult to remain motivated without anyone to discuss it with or to hold any way to hold myself accountable. I was wondering if there was anybody in a similar situation, or even anybody that wants to start reading it, that would also find it beneficial to pair up virtually or go through the textbook together?

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Deepfakes have become increasingly convincing over the years. In collaboration with Michigan State University (MSU), Facebook has presented a research method of detecting and attributing Deepfakes based on reverse engineering from a single AI-generated image to the generative model used to produce the image. The technique will allow deepfake detection and tracing in a real-world scenario, where the often the only information available for deepfake detectors is the image itself.

                <p>I was brought onto a start-up to develop and build out their revenue forecasting processes. Using Prophet I developed two daily forecasting models (an aggregate revenue forecast and an account level revenue forecast) which are utilized throughout the organization. The model utilizes a handful of regressors and even accounts for COVID relatively well without overfitting.
 For the past few months everyone has happy, but now as some COVID related work is starting to dwindle, Prophet has yet to adjust to the re…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Been a weightlifter for almost 2 decades and have seen a lot of these individualized personal trainer apps only be able to provide generalized fitness/nutrition info for folks.
 Has machine learning improved so much that this is achievable / highly accurate now? Or do you think it&#39;d still just provide more general, rather than customized, plans / advice?

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Hey I just got an amazing opportunity as a junior data engineer. (First job starting monday!!) Although my specialisation was as a data analyst, I&#39;m pretty average with big data - pyspark and sql. 
 I&#39;m a fan of kaggle competitions with python and machine learning, but I can&#39;t find interesting projects to upgrade my cv and practice with sql and pyspark. Apparently I&#39;ll be working mainly on cloud/databricks. Any ideas or suggestions of fun projects or books?

                <p>Hi, I’m trying to come up with a model that takes in a photo of a human ear and measures its vertical length. I’ve found a few usable data sets of ear images, but it seems like the key is to label them somehow… Any pointers on where to begin and how to structure the solution? I’m very new to computer vision so would appreciate any and all pointers xx Thank you

 President Bukele just announced that he is implementing a national wallet in September called “chivo” (means cool in Salvadoran slang) 
 The government is giving 30 usd to anyone that creates an account, by law you will have to accept BTC as a company... but the wallet let’s you convert the BTC to usd immediately.
 He mentioned there will be two types of wallets... one for the people and one for companies.
 Apparently the wallet also is compatible with other Bitcoin wallets...

                <p>Anyone who has been in crypto during the past two bull markets wil tell you that one of the biggest mistakes you can make is not formulating a profit taking strategy ahead of time.
 When markets go parabolic you can&#39;t make rational decisions, the hype will distort your views of what&#39;s possible. You end up never taking profits and holding through a crash, and losing all your gains. Also, if a dip happens you&#39;ll be prone to panic selling and can miss out.

 Are there any common ways to measure how &quot;similar&quot; the two datasets are?
 Another application:

 I&#39;ve done some basic object detection projects with transfer learning using Mask R-CNN and YOLO which worked great. However the point of this is to learn how they work and write my own terrible versions.

                <p>The more I learn about the different projects happening around me, the more relieved I am to see the Navy thinking about automated evaluations in its systems. The 2 contractors mentioned, Leidos and Progeny, should be able to deliver a good product, and if it&#39;s implemented well, the risk for casualties and errors should be reduced drastically, and not just for the US. 
 But will the USW-DSS ASW machine really evaluate better than an experienced naval officer?

On a popular view about meta-ethics, what you should value is determined by what an idealized version of you would value. Call this view “idealizing subjectivism.”&nbsp;
Idealizing subjectivism has been something like my best-guess meta-ethics. And lots of people I know take it for granted. But I also feel nagged by various problems with it — in particular, problems related to (a) circularity, (b) indeterminacy, and (c) “passivity.…</p>

 I’m kinda not sure how to handle this. Never had a suicidal friend before. I’m going to assume he’s serious. He’s mentally fucked right now, so we’re going to meet for drinks and lunch.

                <p>As this sub is constantly growing I believe it is important for the newcomers to understand crypto and what they are investing in.
 What is crypto?
 Cryptocurrency is decentralized digital money, based on blockchain technology. You may be familiar with the most popular versions, Bitcoin and Ethereum, but there are more than 5,000 different cryptocurrencies in circulation, according to CoinLore.
 You can use crypto to buy regular goods and services, although many people invest in cryptocurrencies as they wou…</p>

                <p>This is one benefit of the market crash: you can save yourself a bunch of money through a perfectly legal tax loophole.
 All you need to do is create a capital loss. This means you sell crypto for a lower price than you bought it at. For example: If you bought one bitcoin at 60k, and you sell at 30k, you just locked in a capital loss of 30k.
 So why is this important? Because capital losses cancel out capital gains. Since the wash sale rule doesn&#39;t apply, you can instantly buy back your crypto and the l…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>XLM, a decentralized cryptocurrency with fees so low you can send 1000 transactions, costing a cent. Along with its supply cap of 50 billion, meaning more cannot just be “printed”. Yes, I get there are competitors like NANO, but even then I still don’t see it widespread. Some people may say that this is a stable coin in some instances, and well, it’s both a good and bad thing. You can hold XLM without much worry about it crashing a ton overnight, but it still has its volatility.

Are data science interviews still in the works mostly? Or do you know of a good process that will get adopted throughout the industry??

I could not notice a vast difference between BI and Data Analyst roles to warrant creating a separate resume for both.
 Is this valid or is there something I am missing?

                <p>Basically the title.
 I&#39;m working on a project using a Random Forest Classifier, and it performs pretty well on the classification task (precision and recall). However, we will also use the probabilities of being 0 or 1 in some situations. In order to assess the performance of the model in a context of probabilities, I performed a log loss evaluation, getting a value of around 0.5. How do I know whether this is a bad or good cost? I know that the lower the better, but how much lower does this value need…</p>

Because I enjoy ML and data analytics as my job but after work I enjoy other activities, not necessarily doing data analytics and projects in ML.

                <p>Hi all,
 I recently came across the original Tidy Data paper (if you haven&#39;t read this, check it out- I wish I had a long time ago) and have been thinking a lot about how to best reorganize data from my experiments to make analyses and visualization easier. However, my datasets seem kind of unconventional and I haven&#39;t found great examples for how to best tidy them.
 Basically, I continuously collect rodent behavioral data in sessions that span 60 trials. I collect timestamps of events of interest (…</p>

                <p>The Bank of Israel is trying out Ethereum’s technology in a recently launched internal digital shekel trial, a spokesman said.
 In May, the central bank issued a report concluding that the digital payment system could have a positive impact on the economy by simplifying payment processes while providing security to both parties in a transaction.
 The bank has also put out a call for smart application ideas that could run on the digital infrastructure.

                <p>I’ve been dabbling around with Solidity and smart contracts over the past couple of weeks. And the more I learn, the more fascinating the topic becomes to me. To share my fascination, and to create awareness for smart contract vulnerabilities, I decided to create a Solidity riddle. Play along and break the code to get access to the deposited tokens :)

 The GBTC purchase was made via the actively managed ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW), and as of yesterday GBTC is now the ninth-largest holding inside of ARKW at 3.62% of the fund. Wood and team also added just shy of $50M of Coinbas…</p>

SARS-CoV-2, he wrote, or SARS2 for short, the virus that has driven the global COVID-19 pandemic, had likely been modified in a lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, from which it then escaped into the wild. “Neither the natural emergence nor the lab escape hypothesis can yet be ruled out,” Wade wrote. “But it seems to me that proponents of lab …</p>

I have been very much interested in the problem of AGI, how the human mind even exists, and how the brain fundamentally works. I think computational neuroscience is making a lot of headwinds on these questions. Recently, I have been perusing some ML labs that have been working on the problems within cognitive neuroscience as well. I was wondering how these fields interact. If I do a PhD in comp neuro, is there a possibility for me to work in …</p>

                <p>Seeing posts/threads on this topic and I have a hot take: The cleaning is the more interesting of the two. 
 So many posts on this topic and all seem to have an underlying premise that data cleaning sucks and that the modeling is what&#39;s interesting/fun. But the cleaning takes up so much time precisely because it&#39;s very challenging, ambiguous. It&#39;s the part of the process I think will be last to be automated (if it ever is). I get that modeling can provide deep insights and/or value and so are ce…</p>

                <p>I have a mariadb that I need to pipe data from, and into a clickhouse database. It appears that clickhouse does not have mariadb replication available - only mysql. 
 What does it take to do this in a budget friendly way? (no vendor lock-ins or proprietary software licenses as much as possible) 
 It has to have automated, scheduled replication (using CDC/bin log).
 Alternatively, can you suggest an easy to manage olap dwh other than clickhouse?

                <p>Hello guys,
 I saw from this post (two years old) that robotics, NLP, and AR/VR were quite big in Japan. I was wondering if that is still the case? What other additional data science/AI fields are picking up over there? 
 Additionally, I read that there &quot;aren&#39;t many good formal educational opportunities to learn data science. &quot; Is that still true? 
 Lastly, would people in Japan be interested in data science presentations by speakers from Canada and/or the states? 
 Thank you for your time!

                <p>So I vaguely understand what Spark does at a high level. 
 Right now, I&#39;m working as a data analyst. All I do is write SQL queries, conduct exploratory python analysis, build tools, etc. 
 I don&#39;t really do heavy analysis, ML, etc. 
 If my company transitioned to Spark, what would be the impact for me? I would have faster processing times for my SQL and Python Scripts? Access to real time data, rather than waiting on ETLs?

                <p>I have 40k time series from roughly the same distribution (daily product sales over time) and I need to forecast how each will behave.
 How would you approach this? Retrain a really basic model 40k times? Or have a huge model that is trained once with all the data?
 How fast would the prediction work? I mean if it takes 10 seconds for each of the time series, 400k seconds is... a few days :(

 Not too good with this crystal ball stuff. However, I am still DCA in a few coins so with my luck we will see 10k...
 Jokes aside though rough few weeks, but guess it&#39;s best to think of it as a chance to buy with each drop.

What made me confused is that there are so many systematic reviews that included the papers using technologies like e-health, telemedicine without claiming to embed any AI technology in such papers. I feel like the authors overclaimed or made heavy assumption of &quot;AI&quot; to get their papers noticed, or maybe I am wrong.

 I&#39;m working on a project with a client that has sensitive data. He would like me to do the analysis on the data without it being downloaded to my computer. The data needs to stay private.

 I&#39;m hoping you can help me scrape data off of this web map: https://fortress.maptive.com/ver4/66ac434516a4ac2808f0c63f1469ac50
 I haven&#39;t gotten too far, but it looks like the data are loaded by POST requests and come back as JSON. I think a local web server might be needed to do this, and it&#39;s a little above my paygrade. If anyone could point me in the direction of some resources, or is able to say &quot;Oh this will take two minutes, do this!&quot; I&#39;ll be so grateful.
 Thanks so …</p>

                <p>Ya, I get it. Dips are buying opportunities. And bear markets present potentially great opportunities. And I know some of you mean it when you say you hope it keeps going down. But I don&#39;t think a huge continuous slide down is good for crypto long term. I&#39;d rather not have prices drop 50% or 85% more. At whatever price you buy, up means profit. So, I am going to go against the trend and say I hope the market shoots up like crazy and doesn&#39;t go down further. I am ready for my downvotes now. 😆

 If you think it&#39;s $1.5, don&#39;t worry, you are not alone. I know 2 friends who said the same thing.
 You have a total of 50 + 100 = 150 MATIC.
 With a total investment of 200$, your average is 200/150 = $1.33
 Now you only need to wait for it&#39;s price to go up 33% before breaking even.

 For a long time, Chinese controlling Bitcoin and it&#39;s hashrate, was a leading FUD of the opponents of Bitcoin in general. Well…</p>

 Personally i think there is little to no point doing TA on any crypto in a market so controlled by the current BTC price action and also so volatile and sensitive to whales.

My assumption is that the algorithm takes in a bunch of data values e.g. Title, Genre, Length, Actors/Actresses, Producer, etc.

                <p>Did you ever want to see what you look like as an anime waifu? Thanks to the authors of GANs N&#39; Roses you can animefy (pretty sure this isn&#39;t a real word) selfies and even videos with a multitude of unique styles. The authors from the University of Illinois propose a new generator architecture that combines a content code computed from a face image and a randomly chosen style to produce consistent, diverse and controllable anime faces with attributes matching the content image.

 Implementations of some popular optimizers from scratch for a simple model like Linear Regression. The goal of this project was to understand how these optimizers work under the hood and try to do a toy implementation myself. I also use a bit of JAX magic to perform the differentiation of the loss function w.r.t to the weights and the bias without explicitly writing their derivatives as a separate function…</p>

                <p>Hi,
 I have posted this on other subreddits last week but I didn&#39;t get a response so I thought I&#39;d give this one a try. 
 I work as a data analyst at a theme park (kind of like disney) but we operate only during 4-6 months in an year. I was asked to analyze the F&amp;B sales at the different locations in the park and compare this year&#39;s sales with last year&#39;s sales.
 Couple of constraints and issues:

 I am a python developer and I have very little experience in ML and Big data. I am also a professional stock trader.

 I wanna a build a full stack data science project something related to the stock market.

                <p>After much thought, I have decided that getting a masters in data science is the correct career choice for me. I begin my studies this fall, and my first class is python for data analysis. 
 Does anyone have advice they’d like to share? I know the basics of Python and I took an online udemy course for Python with data analysis back in 2019. 
 My goal is to maximize what I learn in this course because I’d really like to increase my use of Python (for data science and just in general)

 Second one you’re still greedy and inexperienced. Probably take profits too early or wait till it’s too late, don’t know how to recognise a top. 
 Third one you already enter with loaded bags and take healthy profits along the way. You realise when the market is cooling off and exit accordingly.

                <p>Hi,
 I have a dataset containing the monthly number of shipments for the years 2014 to 2019. I used the Facebook Prophet algorithm to fit a basic model. However, I am not sure how to implement cross-validation on this data. I could not find any blogs/GitHub files that perform cross-validation on monthly data. Is there a workaround for this?
 Thanks in advance

                <p>I know that GDBT model cannot be parallelized during training because the trees are built sequentially. What about its scoring / making prediction phase for one single sample? 
 As far as I understand, we can evaluate the outputs of all trees at once (hence parallelizable), and the final prediction is just a linear combination. Is that correct?

For the most part, I think Google answers the base line of my questions, but it would be nice to be able to tailor my question based on my role.

Is it so in demand that you can work in pretty much any sector? Is there such thing as an associates in data science?
 Im not very good at math but I plan on taking remedial math in college, assuming they have that; will I be fine? 
 What kind of internships can benefit me to set myself up for success?

 Could I get your opinions on the best value data science bootcamps out there? It&#39;s something I&#39;ve looked at for a long time, but I&#39;ve been hesitant to pick one because there seems to be so many of them.
 The first one that comes to mind is General Assembly, and I also see Springboard. Let me know your experience with these and any others out there.
 Thanks in advance!

 M: If Shiba hit a penny it would be worth all the money currently in circulation (I hadn&#39;t done the math yet, until a couple of seconds later)

 The type of person that stays at a job for a very long time. He&#39;s every employers dream, he will be there until the company goes out of business. You can always count on him. 
 Hes never taken out loans for a car. He saves until he can buy one straight out. He tells me he never wants to deal with the burden of constantly owing money. He even bought his house in full. Seriously. He saved his money for 15 years and held it in an inte…</p>

                <p>At times like these - it&#39;s important to revisit why this all started, and why it&#39;s still so vital. Bitcoin was born as a reaction to the 2008 financial crisis - looking back in brief, remember that:
  
Banks and brokers were giving out cheap, subprime mortgage loans to people they knew would be unable to afford them, fuelling a housing bubble
 
these loans were sold to and then packaged up by Wall Street as financial investments such as mortgage backed securities

                <p>Autoencoders is a kind of neural network where the yield layer has a similar dimensionality as the info layer. In less complex words, the quantity of yield units in the yield layer is equivalent to the number of info units in the information layer. An autoencoder reproduces the information from the contribution to the yield in an unaided way and is hence here and there alluded to as a replicator neural network.

 What is the difference between a Data Analyst and a Database Analyst? 
 Is the occupation of a Data Analyst part of occupation unit group 2172--Database Analysts and Data Administrators? If not, which occupational unit does it fall into in the Canadian National Occupational Classification System?

                <p>Does anyone know what are the most modern statistical models being used for time series analysis? I have heard of transformer and attention mechanisms models that are used for modelling sequential data - but these seem to be more relevant for modelling data from the NLP domain. When it comes to classical time series modelling (e.g. a vector of temperature measurements) : does anyone know what are some of the more modern models being used for this? I did some searching online : it seems like ARIMA style mode…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>I often see in textbooks and blogs, when dealing with Bayesian Models, popular choices of priors seem to be well-known distributions (e.g. the gaussian prior). But how would you go about selecting priors for a specific model?
 For example, suppose you are interested in making some bayesian model (e.g. for causal inference) on some medical data. One of your variables - &#39;smoking status&#39;, you have knowledge that patients who smoke vs patients who don&#39;t smoke have different life expectancies.

                <p>Most of the stock price prediction tutorials use a single stock as example with LSTM models. Although stocks have been proved to be random walks and containing to use LSTM for real time predictions is &quot;not recommended&quot;.
 Say that you stuck to LSTM, how does it happen in real world for 10 different stocks (it could be 20,50, etc.)?
 Do you train 10 different LSTM models? Or use a different approach? 
 The Idea is to tell which amongst these 10 stocks would rise and which ones will dip.

We live in Germany, we’re we are now being charged 11 bucks monthly to even own a checking account. Not to mention the constant micro fees for every freaking single action taken. Every year I get a bank statement with all the fees from the passing year are listed. In 2020 I spend $700 USD on fees! In the mean time, my bank is building huge extravagant offices and paying their Executive brass millions in bonuses.

                <p>Not really a big fan of Warren Buffett, but I think this quote describes perfectly how wealth is accumulated....and it&#39;s why everyone is here. No offense to the traders here, but the goal isn&#39;t to be sitting in front of screens making the right timing decisions...it&#39;s to be letting assets you own accumulate. So congrats for being here and starting on that path...

 Once you&#39;ve done that, save yourself a potentially MASSIVE headache in the future and backup your 2FA. Ask anyone who has lost their primary device how much of a pain in the ass it was to get their access back to all their crypto accounts and you&#39;ll realize why. Most authent…</p>

                <p>TITAN&#39;s crash was really absurd, I personally haven&#39;t seen anything this extreme yet. It crashed almost 100% in a few hours and now sits at 0.00000005% of its ATH. That&#39;s something. I&#39;ve seen many people in the past two days ask stuff like: &quot;sure, it won&#39;t recover from that. But what if I just invest like $10, if it goes back to even just one cent, a tiny fraction of the ATH, that would be a ton of money!&quot;

 So I’ll kick off with Bitcoin - the common knock on it is that there is “no utility” and “environment impact is poor” etc etc.
 (I am not a Bitcoin investor FYI) but my rebuttal to that would be:
  
a store of value is utility in and of itself. If there’s a critical mass of holders at a certain value on a finite resource (as there is with gold for instance) whilst there may be short term price volatility the lack o…</p>

The purpose of this is to have a way to explain the terminology without scaring people off.

The key point is that it does not require any major modifications (like compilation or an entirely new framework) to implement this in the existing code. It also suggested a small modification in the BERT architecture which allowed BERT to scale effectively to parameter sizes that did not perform well on before.

In the fall, COVID cases drop to 10% of their current level. You’re back to working/studying in person. You’re vaccinated, as is everyone else.

                <p>When using XGBregressor to predict propensity scores on a binary classification (eg propensity to convert/churn etc). Would the best performance metric be a regression metric like mae or a classification metric like log loss?

                <p>I graduated with a degree in ML/dataScience 2 years ago and since then been working for a small company as a ML Engineer in their R&amp;D team. Unfortunately, I’m not getting the growth I expected I would in this role. It could be because I’m the only ML engineer, no other data scientist or anyone working on the things I’m working on. Additionally, there’s also no data engineers and no data pipelines, no cloud, the data is all scattered in files and folders. As mentioned, the company is not in Cloud yet, so…</p>

 1 - Everyone’s a genius in a bull market. Real traders can survive and even thrive in bear markets or highly volatile markets.
 2 - Don’t be a blind bull. ALL markets are cyclical. Don’t be afraid of pullbacks or market crashes – that’s where you can make the most money.

 4 - Fully plan your trade before you pull the trigger on the entry.

 Don&#39;t get me wrong, if you buy crypto you will make a significant amount of money, you just have to hold long enough. 5+ years should be your timeframe.

 Alt-seasons are defined as a short-term burst in valuation that outperforms both Bitcoin and its respective historical trends. A famous example of such can be of May 2021&#39;s alt-season, where alt-coins like Ethereum outperformed and hit short-term all-time-highs of 4k (Fig. 1), although different exchanges may vary with exact numbers. These alt-seasons, summarized, are caused by market momentum that disturb cash influx, causing substantially higher amounts of cash to flow into alt-coins.

                <p>Hey everyone, 
 &#x200B;
 I have an interview tomorrow with a financial services company for an entry level Model Developer position within the company&#39;s FP&amp;A group. The position is specifically targeting someone who is pursuing a graduate degree and has familiarity with regression modeling (understanding of time series preferred) in R. I have a pretty solid understanding of regression modeling and have worked on several data cleaning and regression projects that I have referenced on my resume. Alth…</p>

The need for data analytics/science seems to follow the money trail, as larger corporations have been able to collect massive amounts of customer data and thus are willing to pay top dollar to help make sense of it. 
 There are definitely options to do data science in a more impactful way (e.g. non-pr…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Suppose you have a predictive model that has been used for a few years - at what point do people decide to make changes to the model (e.g. add new variables, retrain the model with new data)? Is there a standard procedure for doing this? Are old and new models often run in parallel? 
 I would be curious to hear how this problem is being handled across the industry.
 Thanks

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>I was wondering which crypto subreddits talk about which other coins and how much, so I downloaded the top 1000 posts and all their comments and replies from various crypto subreddits. In the image I&#39;ve plotted the number of comments in which a coin was mentioned as a percentage of all coin mentions (only counting one mention per comment).
 Some biases to be aware of:
 -these are the top comments of all time so perhaps not a fair representation
 -I ensured isolated mentions of the ticker or full crypto …</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Hi all,
 Title says most of it. 
 Whenever things start to dip, I see a lot of people around here post the phrase &quot;buy the dip&quot;. They&#39;re right, it&#39;s a great buying opportunity. 
 Always keep in mind though, it&#39;s possible for the dip to dip, and you&#39;ll want to have some fiat leftover incase that happens.
 TLDR: Buy the dip, but have money leftover incase the dip dips.

The “Dataome” Is Huge
The dataome is shorthand to describe all of the externalized information we generate in symbolic representations: drawings, music, books, computing, data storage. It’s all of the information we utilize and propagate, along with ourselves, through time and space. It’s not encoded in our genes but it’s clearly heritable.

                <p>One of my favorite albeit heavily paraphrased quotes from Albert Einstein is his assertion that the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible. (What he actually said, in his 1936 work “Physics and Reality,” is more longwinded, and includes a digression into Immanuel Kant and the meaning of “comprehensibility”, but he does write “... the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.”) In truth, this statement holds back a little.

It turns out that many people—even some in my progressive, liberal bubble—resist the idea of men becoming feminist dads because they think feminism is inherently “emasculating.” They mistakenly imagine that the move toward gender equality requires a devaluation of manhood. According to…</p>

I work a lot with excel, R and Stata doing summary statistics, linear regressions and transformations. Does that basically sum up this field?

 As the title suggests, off late, I have been struggling to communicate with non-technical stakeholders efficiently.

 I&#39;m looking to use an existing standard as opposed to re-inventing the wheel.

I&#39;ve been working with SQL trying to define patient cohorts for later statistical analysis in R. The SQL work has been slow to my liking but I only started working here in January and on a new database, of which I had to move out from after the first 2 months, to another database (same data source but different structure) so I had to redo a good chunk of the initial progress. I would say I&#39;ve bee…</p>

                <p>What do you think about a cluster analysis to segment customers? I feel like a manual segmentation is often times better, especially when it comes to more personalized marketing. 
 I think that clustering makes sense when there are distinct groups in the population. However, I think that these groups can easily be identified by EDA (finding thresholds of certain variables) in most cases. There is a possibility for identifying relevant groups only through cluster analysis, but I think that a) those cases are…</p>

 I am currently working on my thesis. In this thesis I work with time series data and use a model based on fused regression estimated on a rolling window. Unfortunately I do not habe enough obervations to utilize cross-validation or even any kind of validation. If someone here could point me on something I could use instead to choose my hyperparameters I would be incredibly thankful.

                <p>Hello everyone,
 for a university project we were given the following simple algorithm and I was wondering if it has a name or is similar to an existing method. I&#39;d be glad if you could leave some comments.
 So we have data points with 2 features in 3 evenly distributed categories. One can easily see 3 clusters but there is quite some overlap.
 The suggested method wants us to determine 3 centres, one for each category, and categorize data points by determining the closest centre. These centres should b…</p>

They didn’t write much about the tens of thousands of people who threw in their savings at ATHs, then sold at 40-60% losses in May and June.</summary>

 Maybe the bull market is back and we will see Bitcoin and Eth and Ada at new ATHs this summer. That’s what I believe, but of course no one knows for sure. If so, I’ll bet we also see memecoins like Doge at new highs, and a ton of news stories about the kid in his dad’s basement holding through the May c…</p>

 If you&#39;ve ever had your wallet dusted before, it can be pretty confusing. &quot;Someone gave me free money!&quot; you may think. Like everything in life, there&#39;s no such thing as a free lunch. 
 What is a dusting attack?
 From Gemini...
  
A dusting attack is an attack in which a trace amount of crypto, called dust, is sent to thousands — sometimes even hundreds of thousands — of wallet addresses. This attack is deployed in order to track these addresses with the hope of “un-masking” or de…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Anytime we have 20-50% gains I sell a small portion of profit and reinvest. I’ve tried buying and selling weekly/monthly on lows and highs. Overall it’s better to find projects you like long term and accumulate. I wait for price targets and buy. I wait for sell targets and sell. It’s easy. Don’t panic just stick to the plan. 
 NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.

Frankly, I&#39;m surprised the people behind this coin had enough money to pay her for this promotion. What do you guys think about this?

                <p>Generative models have become synonymous with convolutions and more recently with self-attention, yet we (yes, I am the second author of this paper, yay 🙌) ask the question: are convolutions REALLY necessary to generate state-of-the-art quality images? Perhaps surprisingly a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a couple of clever tricks does just as good (if not better) as specialized convolutional architectures (StyleGAN-2) on 256x256 resolution.

Some were in the range of 70-80%, and a few have been close to 90%.

                <p>I knew a guy called John. me and him had been friends for a long time, nearly 10 years i think. i got into crypto a while back and i&#39;d obviously talk about it with him, encourage him to start as it is a great hobby to have. John claimed he was too &#39;busy&#39; to invest, i.e. playing video games all day and jacking off in his uni dorm room.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>This proposal didn&#39;t pass the threshold of votes last round, but a few people suggested reintroducing the poll for this round too. Hopefully we meet the threshold this round!
 As of now, there is no purpose for Moons on r/Cryptocurrency other than paying 10x more for a monthly membership.

                <p>Knowing my Ethereum is staked and earning interest is amazing, even if I&#39;m doing it on an exchange (Coinbase). The fact that I literally can&#39;t sell, for the nonce at least, means I have no choice but to hodl and not sweat the charts. Such a great feeling.

              <summary>Using Jupyter Notebook vs something else?</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Noob here. I have very basic skills in Python using PyCharm. 
 I just picked up Python for Data Science for Dummies - was in the library (yeah, open for in-person browsing!) and it looked interesting.
 In this book, the author uses Jupyter Notebook. Before I go and install another program and head down the path of learning it, I&#39;m wondering if this is the right tool to be using. 
 My goals: Well, I guess I&#39;d just like to expand my knowledge of Python. I don&#39;t use it for work or anything, yet... …</p>

                <p>Hello all, 
 there is certainly a lot of hype still about Data Science and Machine learning, as somebody who tried &quot;sour side&quot; as well (few failed projects because quality of data, not really significant results) 
 I was wondering if somebody had any success stories, with quick ML projects that had real business impact and were set into process to bring value. Also if it was worth to go down Python way (I have experience doing my master thesis where I used ML) or much quicker way with &quot;pre-de…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>I&#39;m a new grad MS working as an entry-level data scientist. Most of the PhDs at my company are either at the senior level or managerial, but most also have a few years of experience too.
 In general how much years of experience do you need to go from my current level to a senior data scientist and then to the principal/managerial level? I know a few new grad colleagues in SWE who got to senior engineer shortly after one year, but it seems like that trajectory is not exactly the same for DS.
 I know this…</p>

                <p>Science is facing a replication crisis. I am calling for the preregistration of studies. Specifically, which questionable research practices the researchers intend to use. Researchers will submit their hypothesis (or lack thereof) and chosen method of manipulation (p-hacking, HARKing, cherry-picking etc). Completion of preregistration will guarantee non-publication in participating journals. There should also be a similar process for industry.

 Not sure if this post violates the on-topic rule, it is DS-related in the applied sense in terms of being a practicioner, sorry if it is considered OT.
 I usually work locally on my machine, which has always been a laptop with an i7 or i9 with a lower-end nvidia GPU for small to medium-sized modeling tasks. I&#39;m going to start a new job soon and will have my choice of work laptop.

I&#39;ve seen alot of post of the dollar being a shit coin and I agree, however, this is due to the rats in power.
 Crypto is not a hedge against inflation, it is a hedge against them! Don&#39;t forget it, it doesn&#39;t matter what coin you believe in, 😉 we can all agree on this

 How do we send money to inmates?

 The price isn&#39;t going up. 
 What is causing this struggle? Is it covid, what&#39;s happening with the dollar, any SEC things, or is it China again...?

                <p>Could there be any mathematical reasons behind why algorithms like random forest and xgboost are known to win Kaggle competitions (i.e. perform well for medium sized tabular datasets) compared to deep neural networks and linear regression models?
 Heuristically, here are my general conclusions:
 1) GLM (general linear models) perform best on smaller sized datasets, provided certain statistical assumptions are met.
 2) boosting and bagging algorithms (e.g. random forest and xgboost) perform best on larger ta…</p>

The second offer is to work as a project analyst in which I will be working with clients. The company is big but not in the top10 or anything. The advantage of this company is that I’ll be working with clients which means more exposure and connections. They also use near top tech. I&#39;m not sure which one…</p>

                <p>Probably not a popular sentiment here but I&#39;m trying to bring some rationality to the conversation. In the past year, the M2 money supply (which isn&#39;t even really quite all the USD there is) has gone from just under $18T to just over $20T. $2.3T has been &quot;printed&quot; in the past 12 months. It&#39;s a 12.8% increase. 
 But around 8M new Eth are created each year. There was a supply of about 108M a year ago. That&#39;s a 7.4% increase but that remains pretty constant when the USD rate is typica…</p>

                <p>Today, I learnt that only ~60,000 users in our subreddit have moon vaults active. That&#39;s only 2% adoption rate based on the 3 million users in our subreddit. 
 This is quite surprising since it&#39;s a subreddit based on cryptocurrency and it&#39;s opportunities. 
 It&#39;s free cryptocurrency that can actually change your life. One may even call it a low cap gem. Why miss out? Go and set up your vaults!

              <summary>What is "Einsum" equation ?</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>It’ an elegant way to perform matrix or vector manipulation.
 I find it’s extremely useful if I have to perform matrix multiplication of matrices which is of higher dimension, it gives a great flexibility to sum and multiply among certain axis.
 Ex : if you have to multiply matrix A of shape (1,200,2,32) &amp; matrix B of shape (2,32,32) and results in a matrix C of shape (1,200,32).
 This can be implemented as follows:
 np.einsum(‘abcd,cde-&gt;abe’,A,B)
 That’s it !

So our group basically made dictionaries to map existing metadata values to a new label (i.e. apply label x if y exists in metadata).
 In order to improve our dictionaries we repeated a certain exploratory exercise multiple times to discover additional values and add those to the dictionaries and after each update of the dictionaries we repeated the lab…</p>

 21 years ago I was in a business school for programming. I was On my way to barnes and noble to pick up a C++ book when I heard on the radio Barnes and Noble stock flash crashing to a $1 from about $25-$30.

                <p>BTC is somewhere around $15 but you have no knowledge of future pricing. How bullish does this headline make you? Is it too far out there or are you selling your kidneys? Considering how BTC was being mined back then I would probably invest in a dialisys machine first.

 Now I’m sure I’m not the only one but - although causal models are the holy grail, due to time and cost and laziness constraints all my models are just association models, not necessarily causal but observational in nature.
 Easy, so I then communicate the associative nature of model and no DO operator or intervention has been modelled at all. E.g. recently and elasticity model i modelled observed price % change against qty sold % change. But then business takes a mental leap and wants to use they mode…</p>

                <p>I talk to my friends and they tell me they throw X amount into crypto to hold and I wish I could do the same. I&#39;ve started having $5 taken out of each check and thrown into my crypto wallet. It&#39;s not much but it&#39;s better than not investing!

 I&#39;m building a tool that asks personalized follow up questions in order to get detailed survey responses. It&#39;s powered in part by GPT-3 (created by OpenAI). If you&#39;re open to testing it, it takes a couple of minutes...and I welcome feedback.
 It&#39;s imperfect, but that&#39;s why we&#39;re testing ;) Please DM me for a link!
 I&#39;d also love to hear your experiences building standalone AI products like this.

                <p>You are in charge of your own money when you use crypto. This means that there is the possibility for some stupid shit to go down, and the potential for many coins to be lost.
 Around 20% of the current bitcoin supply is lost, and the number of lost coins will continue to increase as more clueless people get into crypto. For every coin that is lost, the owner is making a donation to all other holders by raising the price of their coins. 
 I call this Proof of stupidity
