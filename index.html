There is the possibility to do this at a company, and I so happen to find an application for an internship data science at a profesional football (soccer) club, with the possibility of doing a graduation project there. Since I’m unsure whether they would provide me with a project, and the application is rather vague of what the intern would exactly be doing, I’d like to go …</p>

 I just love me some data is all. So I reposted saying that I meant it, and then the organiser thanked me.

 I&#39;m new and working on a logistic regression model. I have two variables that are (what I would consider) abnormally large at 10.2 and 30.7. I read online that it&#39;s usually a bad sign if this is the case and that this may signal multicollinearity. However, the VIF Factor on these is 1.2 (for both) under the 5.0 that I&#39;ve read signals multicollinearity. Is it OK to leave these in? Should I remove them? Thanks.

I honestly just feel bad for a majority people here talking the talk, thinking they are clever for owning fartbucks or whatever cringe shit is trending.

                <p>I was commissioned to write a litepaper about an upcoming project called &quot;Ardana&quot;, which is set to be based on the Cardano blockchain. I was paid $350 upfront as a 35% deposit for the litepaper. Only a few days into the project, I sent him a draft. He wanted me to add a few things and polish it up.
 Fair enough.
 Anyway, he said he was going to add a few notes for me to work off for the final section. The next day, I had the draft completed and ready to send... when he told me someone else on the …</p>

 I have a question about EDA . So I&#39;ve been working on this project, &quot;The Movie recommendation system&quot;. My dataset is a pretty standard one (https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset). Now I want to understand how much depth should I go into to while performing EDA. Because after a certain point, the conclusions from EDA no longer make the ML model better. However, I can go on making conclusions from the dataset, finding relations between all combinations of features. When …</p>

Maybe I&#39;m weird, but I like having stats and using that to flip around data in simple pivots, then digging into the crosstabs.

 I am looking for pointers on how/where to start the use case of ranking associates. For example, there is a class of 10 students who gave exams for last 3 years and we have the marks in those tests. Now can I use the historical marks for each subject and predict the future marks and rank the associates accordingly. Also can I give suggestions to students on where to improve to get a better rank/marks ?

 When the leadership team tests the tool they pick a few cases they think they know and gauge results that way. I think this cherry picking will lead to problematic decisions. Are there better ways to test search engine results then large test sets?

                <p>I did expect a wild ride this alt season but I did not expect that we would have doge season where there would be tribes of people holding different dog coins arguing with each other. Today I saw a discussion between a doge holder and a shib inu holder about which coin is the better store of value, both very serious.
 I understand if people buy these coins to speculate on a quick buck, or buy it for fun, but someone turning into a hardcore cultist for a dog meme coin is really mind boggling to me.

                <p>Marketcap is the only useful way to compare cryptos with different circulating supply and right now Ethereum has 46.7% of the market cap compared to Bitcoin. At an ETH price of $4,671 (or 0.0807 BTC) the market cap would be exactly half that of Bitcoin based on Bitcoin current price. 
 Given all the services and capabilities on the Ethereum network compared to Bitcoin it is pretty conservative to say it is worth (in terms of marketcap) at least half that of Bitcoin. At Bitcoin&#39;s current price that would…</p>

                <p>This might sound weird but I really want to mimic the voice of a radio host for a voice over of a custom music mix. Of the programs I’ve seen, the only work with your own voice, and I’m not sure if there are any relatively easy ways for me to do this. If this technology exists yet, is there any way that I can learn to do it?

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Applying Deep Learning techniques to complex control tasks depends on simulations before transferring models to the real world. However, there is a challenging “reality gap” associated with such transfers since it is difficult for simulators to precisely capture or predict the dynamics and visual properties of the real world.
 Domain randomization methods are some of the most effective approaches to handle this issue. A model is incentivized to learn features invariant to the shift between simulation and re…</p>

 I was just wondering if I was on the low side of number of hours people work a day. I talked to a friend who works at Amazon and they said that they do 8 hours of work. By work I mean when you&#39;re sitting on your desk and doing stuff. Not including the meetings, although I understand meetings are also part of work. I realized I do maybe 4 hours of actual work, rest is just thinking about some stuff for work, lunch, break etc. It&#39;s hard to imagine how can someone just sit and do 8 hours. Won&#39;…</p>

                <p>A huge amount of buzz was set up around Shikokuaido (SHOKK)&#39;s launch today, with a tonne of telegram channels et. al claiming that it&#39;s the newest coin release from SHIB&#39;s team, which recently got listed on Binance, boasting well over $1bn in market cap.
 There was no proof behind that one, but given their telegram was set to restrict all inbound messages, there was no way for anyone to ask pre-launch. The launch obviously followed with the usual &quot;ALL FUD WILL BE BANNED&quot; warning.

 I must say I am really impressed, even for crypto I&#39;ve never seen anything like it. Sadly I missed it, would have bought more. ETH is so incredibly bullish right now.

 It’s just whales making up for their loss, preparing their bags to invest in stocks that just dipped, pumping it back up and putting that money again in cryptos.

 From their website:
  
SHIB is an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building. SHIB token is our first token and allows users to hold Billions or even Trillions of them. Nicknamed the DOGECOIN KILLER, this ERC-20 ONLY token can remain well under a penny and still outpace Dogecoin in a small amount of time (relatively speaking).

And philosophy has no other point of departure than this.” The word, which contains the root thauma, the same that appears in thaumaturgy, has often been translated as “wonder.” Philosophy is born out of amazement mixed with the curiosity that arises from facing something inexplicable that fascinates and transcends us.

Seahorses seem to have evolved not entirely in the ocean, but also by way of a whimsical storybook, in which animal body parts are all mixed up. A fish with the head of a horse? A male that gets pregnant, gives birth, and is monogamous?

Rohin Shah, and probably others1, have argued against this. I want to argue against them.

This is a story where the alignment problem is somewhat harder than I expect, society handles AI more competently than I expect, and the outcome is worse than I expect. It also involves inner alignment turning out to be a surprisingly small problem. Maybe the story is 10-20th percentile on each of those axes. At the end I’m going to go through some salient ways you could vary the story.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Like most American high school students, I was required to take Chemistry and English. Chemistry thrilled only by way of the absurdity of allowing kids like me to play with volatile compounds and an open flame. English provided little of that thrill save, perhaps, Holden Caulfield’s excessive swearing or Huckleberry Finn’s audacity in heading down the big river after faking his own death.

After all, you’ve probably heard otherwise. Grit is everywhere. By the time you read this, it will have been a golden child of the world of education for well over a decade.
