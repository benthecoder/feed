 Work from home has been wonderful ever since it has been implemented but I&#39;ve found myself not working much on days like today. I just wasn&#39;t feeling like it. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a good thing or a bad thing about work from home. 
 Do you guys have days like this too?

 Now I’m sure I’m not the only one but - although causal models are the holy grail, due to time and cost and laziness constraints all my models are just association models, not necessarily causal but observational in nature.
 Easy, so I then communicate the associative nature of model and no DO operator or intervention has been modelled at all. E.g. recently and elasticity model i modelled observed price % change against qty sold % change. But then business takes a mental leap and wants to use they mode…</p>

 Is a multivariate Cox regression model appropriate for this problem, where the &quot;event&quot; is the product being sold out? What about if the items can be restocked (i.e. by users issuing returns), effectively increasing the stock in the process?

 &quot;Don&#39;t. It&#39;s trash. Bivariate (one independent and one dependent) models don’t tell you much other than confirming if there is a strong correlation.&quot;

                <p>Hi!
 I&#39;m building a tool that asks personalized follow up questions in order to get detailed survey responses. It&#39;s powered in part by GPT-3 (created by OpenAI). If you&#39;re open to testing it, it takes a couple of minutes...and I welcome feedback.
 It&#39;s imperfect, but that&#39;s why we&#39;re testing ;) Please DM me for a link!
 I&#39;d also love to hear your experiences building standalone AI products like this.

                <p>Hello all, not sure if this is allowed here or not, but I received a DS Case Study from a big pharma company in USA.

                <p>You are in charge of your own money when you use crypto. This means that there is the possibility for some stupid shit to go down, and the potential for many coins to be lost.
 Around 20% of the current bitcoin supply is lost, and the number of lost coins will continue to increase as more clueless people get into crypto. For every coin that is lost, the owner is making a donation to all other holders by raising the price of their coins.

                <p>Human-induced climate change may seem a purely modern phenomenon. Even in ancient Greece, however, people understood that human activities can change climate. Later the early United States was a lab for observing this as its settlers altered nature. By 1800 it was known that the mass clearing of forests raised temperatures in the Eastern U.S. and that climatic changes followed the pioneers as they spread west.
 The causes for such changes, and the understanding that they could have global scope, came from e…</p>

                <p>The science you can come across today can often appear to be full of contradictory claims. One study tells you red wine is good for your heart; another tells you it is not. Over the past year, COVID-19 research has offered conflicting reports about the overall effectiveness of wearing a mask. As scientists debate what policy best suits the current moment, they will be drawing on hundreds of studies; some that say masks are effective1 and some that say masks alone are not enough.2

Most overviews of aging suffer from multiple problems:

They dump a bunch of findings with no high-level picture.
Many of the claims they make are outdated, purely theoretical, and sometimes even outright disproven by existing work.
They are usually written by working academics, who are shy about telling us when their peers’ work is completely wrong.
They are shy about making strong claims, since this would also implicitly mean denying some claims of the authors’ pe…</p>

                <p>In 1777—after whipping local people for trivial offenses, spreading venereal disease, and clumsily avoiding a plot to kill him—the English explorer James Cook left the shores of Tonga laden with treasures. Not least among them was a word scrawled in his ship’s logbook: tabu, which he defined as “a thing that is forbidden,” like a fish that could only be eaten by kings or a lagoon where fishing was prohibited. Cook died not long after, but his crew brought the word back to Europe, where it gave rise to the E…</p>

The natural abstraction hypothesis says that

Our physical world abstracts well: for most systems, the information relevant “far away” from the system (in various senses) is much lower-dimensional than the system itself. These low-dimensional summaries are exactly the high-level abstract objects/concepts typically used by humans.
These abstractions are “natural”: a wide variety of cognitive architectures will learn to use approximately the same high-level abstract obj…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Julian Barbour’s obsession with time began on Oct. 18, 1963. The 26-year-old Cambridge graduate in mathematics was on a train to the Bavarian alps, where he and a friend planned to climb the Watzmann, Germany’s third highest peak. The newspaper in his hand contained a summary of a Scientific American article by British physicist Paul Dirac. “He questioned whether four-dimensional symmetries are a fundamental feature of the physical world,” Barbour recalled. Dirac was pulling apart Einstein’s conception of t…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>It seemed inevitable that Elon Musk would eventually get into a Twitter war over whether Mars can be terraformed. When you’re on Twitter, he told Businessweek in July, 2018, you’re “in meme war land.” “And so essentially if you attack me,” he said, “it is therefore okay for me to attack back.”
 Musk, the CEO and lead designer of SpaceX, wants to “make life multiplanetary,” starting with Mars. “Public support for life on Mars is critical to making it happen,” he tweeted last week. The red planet is relativel…</p>

                <p>In the late afternoon of May 5, SpaceX’s Elon Musk tweeted, “Starship landing nominal!” Musk is not known for understatement. But seeing that stainless steel behemoth soar was, for many, something more like phenomenal. Over 5 million people watched the spectacle on YouTube, perhaps many with bated breath, as every prior attempt at landing Starship had gone up in flames. Not SN15. This Starship, after having climbed 12 kilometers and then coasted down in a “belly flop” configuration—using its wide silver bod…</p>
