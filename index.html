                <p>Our team works on various models and prediction problems. Sometimes we get bogged down in discussion about better approaches and want to test new ideas. In each team members specific individual scripts they have test and evaluation data which makes true side by side comparisons trickier than otherwise.
 My question is, is there a service, open source server or even a paid tool where we could send our predictions to be tested against a single universal out of sample test set for model evaluation?

                <p>I always see amazing glassdoor ratings for small (&lt;500 employee) companies and wonder if this is genuine. The general story seems to be that work-life balance is a lot better at large companies like fortune 500s, but glassdoor seems to disagree. Is this a coincidence with the companies I&#39;m looking at, or this there something I&#39;m missing? Is it just that start-ups expect no work-life balance so they give it 5*?
 Also, any tips on finding a job with work-life balance? (currently an overworked data …</p>

                <p>Hi!
 I was just wondering if I was on the low side of number of hours people work a day. I talked to a friend who works at Amazon and they said that they do 8 hours of work. By work I mean when you&#39;re sitting on your desk and doing stuff. Not including the meetings, although I understand meetings are also part of work. I realized I do maybe 4 hours of actual work, rest is just thinking about some stuff for work, lunch, break etc. It&#39;s hard to imagine how can someone just sit and do 8 hours. Won&#39;…</p>

 Title says it all. Thus far, I&#39;ve been focusing my search on data science, and to be honest, data analytics positions. For those of you within data engineering, do you feel that the entry level market is significantly less saturated? Or about the same?

Based on this information, could you argue that in this example, males are at higher risk of experiencing some unfavorable &quot;event&quot; (e.g. let&#39;s assume that this example is about surviving some medical condition) and therefore should be initially paid more attention to compared to …</p>

                <p>I’m seeing so many people just not have any understanding of one of the most basic measurements of valuation. If you don’t know what “market cap” means and you’re trying to get in early on “moonshots,” I’m begging you to take 2 minutes to read.
 Market capitalization is the total value of all members of an asset. Just circulating supply * price.
 What does it tell us? It lets us know how much money is in it, and how it compares to other coins.
 Take SHIB for an example. It has a circulating supply of 400 tr…</p>

I have to give him credit because he is the one that got me into crypto in the first place and even told me to buy ETH. Selling at $4000 is cutting myself way too short. My job covers all of my expenses so I&#39;m not desperate for money and can wait until it reaches my price target, then sell some and HODL the rest.

                <p>Hi everyone, I am back with another long one! 
 &nbsp;
 As someone with a masters degree in Financial Economics, I have seen many theories over the years, and quite frankly, since last year almost all of them have been proven useless in the real world. Maybe useless is the wrong word, but since the pandemic, the market has not made a whole load of sense theory-wise.

 However, there is one theory that I want to highlight today, as it appears to be more relevant than ever in the cryptocurrency market…</p>

After getting stressed out about the ups and downs, I decided I have put my money in coins I believe in and I would stop constantly checking it.
 Well now it finally happened. I haven&#39;t looked at my portfolio in the last 36 hours or so(…</p>

 Often when talking about Cardano a comparison is drawn to Tezos and how Tezos is way ahead of Cardano.
 Which got me thinking, why don’t we talk more about Tezos here? How come we hear so much about Cardano instead?

 However this growth isn&#39;t entirely surprising going by the Bitcoin cycle - the Bitcoin halving event has instigated a bull market on three occasions now.

                <p>ETH went from around 4150 to 3600 in 15 minutes, I&#39;m guessing a whale dumped a ton of ETH and the new traders started to freak out and thus the panic selling began. But Oh My God, not even 15 minutes later ETH is almost at 4000 again. 
 I must say I am really impressed, even for crypto I&#39;ve never seen anything like it. Sadly I missed it, would have bought more. ETH is so incredibly bullish right now.

 It’s just whales making up for their loss, preparing their bags to invest in stocks that just dipped, pumping it back up and putting that money again in cryptos.

                <p>In a polarized nation, victimhood is a badge of honor. It gives people strength. “The victim has become among the most important identity positions in American politics,” wrote Robert B. Horwitz, a communications professor at the University of California, San Diego.
Horwitz published his study, “Politics as Victimhood, Victimhood as Politics,” in 2018.1 He focused on social currents that drove victimhood to the fore of American political life, arguing it “emerged from the contentious politics of the 1960s, …</p>

                <p>My friend Robert Burton, a neurologist and author, wanted to share a song with me last year, and sent me a link to an NPR Tiny Desk Concert. “It’s wonderful to see truly new and inspiring music,” he wrote. I clicked open the link to a band who appeared to have journeyed from their mountain village in Russia to busk for tourists in the city square.

And philosophy has no other point of departure than this.” The word, which contains the root thauma, the same that appears in thaumaturgy, has often been translated as “wonder.” Philosophy is born out of amazement mixed with the curiosity that arises from facing something inexplicable that fascinates and transcends us.

Seahorses seem to have evolved not entirely in the ocean, but also by way of a whimsical storybook, in which animal body parts are all mixed up. A fish with the head of a horse? A male that gets pregnant, gives birth, and is monogamous?

[Epistemic status: my current view, but I haven’t read all the stuff on this topic even in the LessWrong community, let alone more broadly.]
There is a line of thought that says that advanced AI will tend to be ‘goal-directed’—that is, consistently doing whatever makes certain favored outcomes more likely—and that this is to do with the ‘coherence arguments’. Rohin Shah, and probably others1, have argued against this. I want to argue against them.

I just finished Karen Pryor’s “Don’t Shoot the Dog: the New Art of Teaching and Training.” Partly because a friend points out that it’s not on Audible and therefore she can’t possibly read it, here are the notes I took and some thoughts. It’s a quick, easy read.
The book applies behavioral psychology to training animals and people. The author started off as a dolphin trainer at an aquarium park in the 1960s and moved on to horses, dogs, and her own children. There are…</p>

Having broken into the entertainment big leagues at such a young age, MacFarlane was invited back in September to address his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design. After giving a talk, he went out for what turned out to be a late night of drinking with some professors. 
The next morning, September 11, MacFarlane raced to catch an 8:15 a.m. flight out of Boston back to Los Angeles…</p>

While there, Vavilov attended lectures at nearby Cambridge University, and could often be seen bicycling around the city in his trademark suit and tie. He and Bateson became lifelong friends, and the Mendelian genetics that Bateson and his team championed—and that remains the core of the field of genetics to this day—was burned into Vavilov’s sci…</p>

Some of the people running those farms came from so many generations that they could point to the sites of their forebears’ land-working going back over four centuries. As a child it was fascinating to hear the farmers reflect on the profound changes wrought to that land and their little-concealed wonderment at the…</p>

This is a story where the alignment problem is somewhat harder than I expect, society handles AI more competently than I expect, and the outcome is worse than I expect. It also involves inner alignment turning out to be a surprisingly small problem. Maybe the story is 10-20th percentile on each of those axes. At the end I’m going to go through some salient ways you could vary the story.
