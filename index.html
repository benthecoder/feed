                <p>Noob here. I have very basic skills in Python using PyCharm. 
 I just picked up Python for Data Science for Dummies - was in the library (yeah, open for in-person browsing!) and it looked interesting.
 In this book, the author uses Jupyter Notebook. Before I go and install another program and head down the path of learning it, I&#39;m wondering if this is the right tool to be using. 
 My goals: Well, I guess I&#39;d just like to expand my knowledge of Python. I don&#39;t use it for work or anything, yet... …</p>

 In general how much years of experience do you need to go from my current level to a senior data scientist and then to the principal/managerial level? I know a few new grad colleagues in SWE who got to senior engineer shortly after one year, but it seems like that trajectory is not exactly the same for DS.

                <p>So this is not a personal problem, I don’t know anyone that is in jail currently but I thought about this for the past couple of days and did some research on it.
 How do we send money to inmates?
 Currently, in the US, there are 2 ways, 
 1- Western Union and we all know that this have insane fees
 2- Jpay, the most commonly used that usually takes 1 to 2 days to transfer the money but it can be up to 10 days! Fees are up to 11$ for a single transfer + credit/debit cards fees. This is not right.

                <p>James Howells, 35, said he mistakenly put a hard drive with 7,500 bitcoins in the trash while clearing out his home in 2013. He claims he had two identical laptop hard drives, and that he mistakenly put the one that contained Bitcoin in the trash.

 He needs permission from his local council to search a garbage dump he believes contains the lost hardware. The landfill is not open to the public and trespassing would be considered a criminal offense.
 But the Newport City Council has so far rejected …</p>

                <p>This whole thing makes no sense to me. It seems that news of bitcoin adoption; El Salvador, banks storing assets, states accepting bitcoin plus the fact there are tons of news about it, more companies experimenting etc... isn&#39;t doing anything. 
 The price isn&#39;t going up. 
 What is causing this struggle? Is it covid, what&#39;s happening with the dollar, any SEC things, or is it China again...? 
 Just hoping to get a good thread started with what people, news, thoughts and opinions.

                <p>This is getting so old and predictable. The weekend comes and the whales drive the price down with heavy selling on thin volume hoping to get others to sell so they can pick up more at lower prices. 
 At some point, doesn’t it just become white noise? When it does and people don’t react, they won’t do it anymore.

 There are so many new subs to this forum and a lot of them are Coinbase users. Yeah Coinbase has a cool graph that shows you your portfolio. It’s also very easy to use for a beginner. 
 Now there is nothing wrong with Coinbase (except, of course, the mind boggling fees) but I haven’t seen any post addressing how to use Coinbase without paying crazy fees or at least the best strategy to pay as little fees as possible. So here we go.

 1) GLM (general linear models) perform best on smaller sized datasets, provided certain statistical assumptions are met.
 2) boosting and bagging algorithms (e.g. random forest and xgboost) perform best on larger ta…</p>

                <p>I&#39;m a senior at university and I got a pretty nice internship somehow. I keep getting assigned work with nlp stuff that I don&#39;t know how to do. I read the theory behind it some time ago and I watch youtube videos, but I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to practice yet. Is this feeling of not knowing what you&#39;re doing normal? I&#39;ve mainly worked with basic machine learning in the past, not much deep learning.

                <p>Hi all. I have two offers. One is from a big4bank for a data analyst internship (pays less) but I believe they use state of art technology and there is a lot to learn; The work is all for internal stuff. The second offer is to work as a project analyst in which I will be working with clients. The company is big but not in the top10 or anything. The advantage of this company is that I’ll be working with clients which means more exposure and connections. They also use near top tech. I&#39;m not sure which one…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Probably not a popular sentiment here but I&#39;m trying to bring some rationality to the conversation. In the past year, the M2 money supply (which isn&#39;t even really quite all the USD there is) has gone from just under $18T to just over $20T. $2.3T has been &quot;printed&quot; in the past 12 months. It&#39;s a 12.8% increase. 
 But around 8M new Eth are created each year. There was a supply of about 108M a year ago. That&#39;s a 7.4% increase but that remains pretty constant when the USD rate is typica…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Today, I learnt that only ~60,000 users in our subreddit have moon vaults active. That&#39;s only 2% adoption rate based on the 3 million users in our subreddit. 
 This is quite surprising since it&#39;s a subreddit based on cryptocurrency and it&#39;s opportunities. 
 It&#39;s free cryptocurrency that can actually change your life. One may even call it a low cap gem. Why miss out? Go and set up your vaults!

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>It’ an elegant way to perform matrix or vector manipulation.
 I find it’s extremely useful if I have to perform matrix multiplication of matrices which is of higher dimension, it gives a great flexibility to sum and multiply among certain axis.
 Ex : if you have to multiply matrix A of shape (1,200,2,32) &amp; matrix B of shape (2,32,32) and results in a matrix C of shape (1,200,32).
 This can be implemented as follows:
 np.einsum(‘abcd,cde-&gt;abe’,A,B)
 That’s it !

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Data scientists, every day, face manually stitching together Machine Learning point solutions and finding anomalies, resulting in a lag in model creation and experimentation, hence reducing the production level. To address these issues, Google announced Vertex AI, a managed machine learning platform meant to expedite the development and maintenance of artificial intelligence (AI) models to be generally available.

 Hi, I used a feed forward neural network on Keras to approximate a concave one dimensional function , I would like to find the argmax and the max of my neural network, what would be the easiest way to solve this ? Should I implement something myself or does Keras already have some buil in function for that ?

 I&#39;m looking to do some research I&#39;ve never done before; to track / visualize how many times a word has been mentioned on a website and on what dates they were mentioned. 
 So for example, lets say I want to get data on how many times the word &quot;Covid-19&quot; has been mentioned on a specific news website on each date over the past 2 years. I don&#39;t have a clue on how to attach a date to each mention, how could I do this? 
 Thanks in advance!

 Now I’m sure I’m not the only one but - although causal models are the holy grail, due to time and cost and laziness constraints all my models are just association models, not necessarily causal but observational in nature.
 Easy, so I then communicate the associative nature of model and no DO operator or intervention has been modelled at all. E.g. recently and elasticity model i modelled observed price % change against qty sold % change. But then business takes a mental leap and wants to use they mode…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Hi, I&#39;m trying to construct a model that takes in the first two/three input values from the user and based on those values, decides the best 4th independent variable to ask the user to optimize the time needed to bucket the user into one of the 5-6 different buckets (supervised clusters). The initial approaches that I was considering were bidirectional LSTM/RNN&#39;s.. but after reading up on these two, I&#39;m now thinking there may be more suitable/clever approaches to tackles this. Thank you, deep le…</p>

                <p>A research team from UC Berkeley, Facebook AI Research and Google Brain abstracts Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a sequence modelling problem. Their proposed Decision Transformer simply outputs optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked transformer, yet matches or exceeds state-of-the-art model-free offline RL baselines on Atari, OpenAI Gym, and Key-to-Door tasks.

                <p>Google researcher’s new study suggests modifying the conventional transformer architecture to process byte sequences in natural language processing (NLP). The new competitive byte-level models can effectively balance computational cost trade-offs of contemporary large language models.
 Tokenization splits the sentences into a sequence of tokens. Most NLP tasks follow a tokenization procedure to preprocess the data. However, tokenization can struggle with typos, irregularities in spelling and capitalization,…</p>

                <p>I was curious what people&#39;s opinion of Algorand is. I have read up on it. It seems really legit. It has great support and seems well thought out. Just the people behind it give it so much credit.
 The only negative I&#39;ve heard is it has inflationary tokenomics.
 Am I missing something as to why it isn&#39;t very popular? Please try to answer with only factual, not emotional or biased, responses.
 Thank you!

 I&#39;m building a tool that asks personalized follow up questions in order to get detailed survey responses. It&#39;s powered in part by GPT-3 (created by OpenAI). If you&#39;re open to testing it, it takes a couple of minutes...and I welcome feedback.
 It&#39;s imperfect, but that&#39;s why we&#39;re testing ;) Please DM me for a link!
 I&#39;d also love to hear your experiences building standalone AI products like this.

                <p>According to media reporters, FBI claims that it can get access to bitcoin stored anywhere. That is just impossible, unless somehow they have developed ways to crack SHA256 and brute force wallet private keys. In which case, BTC is the least of everyone&#39;s worries and state/nuclear secrets could be under risk. 
 While Bitcoin isn’t stored on a server, the private keys to unlock the Bitcoin may have been. In any event, an FBI official just told reporters that it doesn’t matter where the Bitcoin wallet is—…</p>

The utterance emerged in February 2019 from Fox &amp; Friends presenter Pete Hegseth, who was referring to … germs. The former Princeton University undergraduate and Afghanistan counterinsurgency instructor said, to the mirth of his co-hosts, that he hadn’t washed his hands in a decade.

                <p>In 1777—after whipping local people for trivial offenses, spreading venereal disease, and clumsily avoiding a plot to kill him—the English explorer James Cook left the shores of Tonga laden with treasures. Not least among them was a word scrawled in his ship’s logbook: tabu, which he defined as “a thing that is forbidden,” like a fish that could only be eaten by kings or a lagoon where fishing was prohibited. Cook died not long after, but his crew brought the word back to Europe, where it gave rise to the E…</p>

The natural abstraction hypothesis says that

Our physical world abstracts well: for most systems, the information relevant “far away” from the system (in various senses) is much lower-dimensional than the system itself. These low-dimensional summaries are exactly the high-level abstract objects/concepts typically used by humans.
These abstractions are “natural”: a wide variety of cognitive architectures will learn to use approximately the same high-level abstract obj…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>In the 21st century, neuroscience has been able to extend our understanding of the brain beyond brain anatomy to an increasingly functional view of cognition. Every year brings new insights on memory and imagination, and reveals often surprising areas of convergence with fields such as anthropology and philosophy. Yet it was a Cambridge professor of literature, almost a century ago in the aftermath of World War I, who pioneered a view of cognition we can recognize as strikingly modern, and who appreciated w…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>A few years ago, Time magazine published an article titled, “Cell-Phone Distracted Parenting Can Have Long Term Consequences.”1 It reported research supposedly showing that “distracted parental attention” could hurt infant development, and especially a baby’s ability to feel pleasure later on. What exactly did this research study? Did it directly measure parental cell phone usage and test infant cognition? Did it carefully document day-to-day distractions in the lives of caregivers?
Not exactly. The article…</p>

                <p>When Ilya Metchnikoff was 8 and running around on his parents’ Panassovka estate in Little Russia, now Ukraine, he was making notes on the local flora like a junior botanist. He gave science lectures to his older brothers and local kids whose attendance he assured by paying them from his pocket money. Metchnikoff earned the nickname “Quicksilver” because he was in constant motion, always wanting to see, taste, and try everything, from studying how his father played card games to learning to sew and embroide…</p>

                <p>The Nobel Prize-winning biologist Peter Medawar (1915–1987) is best known for work that made the first organ transplants and skin grafts possible. Medawar was also a lively, witty writer who penned numerous books on science and philosophy.

Most of the work on inner alignment so far has been informal or semi-formal (with the notable exception of a little work on minimal circuits). I feel this has resulted in some misconceptions about the problem. I want to write up a large document clearly defining the formal problem and detailing some formal directions for research. Here, I outline my intentions, inviting the reader to provide feedback and point me to any formal work or areas of potential formal work whi…</p>
