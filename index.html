 These pictures are supposed to show the decision boundaries of different machine learning algorithms on a binary classification task. There are two classes for the response variable: &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot;.
 Shouldn&#39;t all the decision boundaries either be fully red or fully blue? What do the shades of white mean? Does this mean &quot;an overlapping decision boundary&quot;?

                <p>Does anyone know what are the most modern statistical models being used for time series analysis? I have heard of transformer and attention mechanisms models that are used for modelling sequential data - but these seem to be more relevant for modelling data from the NLP domain. When it comes to classical time series modelling (e.g. a vector of temperature measurements) : does anyone know what are some of the more modern models being used for this? I did some searching online : it seems like ARIMA style mode‚Ä¶</p>

              <summary>Has anyone had any experience selecting priors for Bayesian Models in real life?</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>I often see in textbooks and blogs, when dealing with Bayesian Models, popular choices of priors seem to be well-known distributions (e.g. the gaussian prior). But how would you go about selecting priors for a specific model?
 For example, suppose you are interested in making some bayesian model (e.g. for causal inference) on some medical data. One of your variables - &#39;smoking status&#39;, you have knowledge that patients who smoke vs patients who don&#39;t smoke have different life expectancies.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Most of the stock price prediction tutorials use a single stock as example with LSTM models. Although stocks have been proved to be random walks and containing to use LSTM for real time predictions is &quot;not recommended&quot;.
 Say that you stuck to LSTM, how does it happen in real world for 10 different stocks (it could be 20,50, etc.)?
 Do you train 10 different LSTM models? Or use a different approach? 
 The Idea is to tell which amongst these 10 stocks would rise and which ones will dip.

                <p>Honestly, if there is anything that will speed up adoption of crypto, it‚Äôs the crooked banks. We live in Germany, we‚Äôre we are now being charged 11 bucks monthly to even own a checking account. Not to mention the constant micro fees for every freaking single action taken. Every year I get a bank statement with all the fees from the passing year are listed. In 2020 I spend $700 USD on fees! In the mean time, my bank is building huge extravagant offices and paying their Executive brass millions in bonuses.

 If you are active in crypto-related subreddits you&#39;ll soon notice a (understandable) misconception:
 New users tend to think that their coins are stored in their wallet. Therefore, they ask questions like: &quot;what happens to my coins if I delete my wallet? How can I move my voins to my new PC etc.
 I find it necessary to stress the follwing fact:
 Your wallet does not hold any coins. Your coins are not stored in your wallet

 Once you&#39;ve done that, save yourself a potentially MASSIVE headache in the future and backup your 2FA. Ask anyone who has lost their primary device how much of a pain in the ass it was to get their access back to all their crypto accounts and you&#39;ll realize why. Most authent‚Ä¶</p>

                <p>TITAN&#39;s crash was really absurd, I personally haven&#39;t seen anything this extreme yet. It crashed almost 100% in a few hours and now sits at 0.00000005% of its ATH. That&#39;s something. I&#39;ve seen many people in the past two days ask stuff like: &quot;sure, it won&#39;t recover from that. But what if I just invest like $10, if it goes back to even just one cent, a tiny fraction of the ATH, that would be a ton of money!&quot;
 And yes, it absolutely would be! And that alone should be enough to tel‚Ä¶</p>

 (I am not a Bitcoin investor FYI) but my rebuttal to that would be:
  
a store of value is utility in and of itself. If there‚Äôs a critical mass of holders at a certain value on a finite resource (as there is with gold for instance) whilst there may be short term price volatility the lack o‚Ä¶</p>

 Obviously that means moons are the poor mans bitcoin. A place to talk about crypto generates tons of traffic. Being the number 1 in that department means this subs own crypto is in it&#39;s early stages of exploding.

I have been compiling a list of terms that are used in crypto with some basic explanations of what they are. The purpose of this is to have a way to explain the terminology without scaring people off.

                <p>Megatron-LM provides a simple yet innovative approach on how to parallelize models to train large (multi-billion parameters) language models and efficiently use GPU memory during scaling. The key point is that it does not require any major modifications (like compilation or an entirely new framework) to implement this in the existing code. It also suggested a small modification in the BERT architecture which allowed BERT to scale effectively to parameter sizes that did not perform well on before.

                <p>Too many people treat this like a casino or like the latest r/wallstreetbets stock play. Crypto is a long game. People that bought the peak in 2017 had to wait three years to break even, it&#39;s not always a quick process.
 Don&#39;t get me wrong, if you buy crypto you will make a significant amount of money, you just have to hold long enough. 5+ years should be your timeframe.
 Big gains in crypto require diamond balls and years of holding.

                <p>ABTRACT
 Alt-seasons are defined as a short-term burst in valuation that outperforms both Bitcoin and its respective historical trends. A famous example of such can be of May 2021&#39;s alt-season, where alt-coins like Ethereum outperformed and hit short-term all-time-highs of 4k (Fig. 1), although different exchanges may vary with exact numbers. These alt-seasons, summarized, are caused by market momentum that disturb cash influx, causing substantially higher amounts of cash to flow into alt-coins.

                <p>Sorry if this isn‚Äôt the right place to post this. I am doing a project to monitor signals from several sensors and using Amazon AWS to store the data. I want to take the data from the S3 bucket, apply a machine learning model on it and add the prediction result into the bucket. Is Amazon sagemaker the appropriate tool or is it something else? Any links for a tutorial are appreciated.

The position is specifically targeting someone who is pursuing a graduate degree and has familiarity with regression modeling (understanding of time series preferred) in R. I have a pretty solid understanding of regression modeling and have worked on several data cleaning and regression projects that I have referenced on my resume. Alth‚Ä¶</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Suppose you have a predictive model that has been used for a few years - at what point do people decide to make changes to the model (e.g. add new variables, retrain the model with new data)? Is there a standard procedure for doing this? Are old and new models often run in parallel? 
 I would be curious to hear how this problem is being handled across the industry.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Hi all,
 Title says most of it. 
 Whenever things start to dip, I see a lot of people around here post the phrase &quot;buy the dip&quot;. They&#39;re right, it&#39;s a great buying opportunity. 
 Always keep in mind though, it&#39;s possible for the dip to dip, and you&#39;ll want to have some fiat leftover incase that happens.
 TLDR: Buy the dip, but have money leftover incase the dip dips.

 As the title suggests, off late, I have been struggling to communicate with non-technical stakeholders efficiently. For example, there was this one time where one of the stakeholders asked me to explain what a model did and I ended up combining a few technical terms together in a sentence which ended up confusing the stakeholder even more.
 It is not that I suck at communicating in general. If I were to have a conversation regarding a simple analysis/explaining some viz, I do it pretty well. But, w‚Ä¶</p>

 Do you use any specific tools to keep up a good gitlfow-like version control scheme of your data science jupyter notebooks?

                <p>Topic. Given the lack of future covariates, can one use (S)ARIMAX to predict k (instead of just one) time steps ahead?
 Another related question: Can we use SARIMAX to predict non-negative integer series, such as count of item sale? If yes, how? If not, which alternatives do you recommend?

                <p>What do you think about a cluster analysis to segment customers? I feel like a manual segmentation is often times better, especially when it comes to more personalized marketing. 
 I think that clustering makes sense when there are distinct groups in the population. However, I think that these groups can easily be identified by EDA (finding thresholds of certain variables) in most cases. There is a possibility for identifying relevant groups only through cluster analysis, but I think that a) those cases are‚Ä¶</p>

 So we have data points with 2 features in 3 evenly distributed categories. One can easily see 3 clusters but there is quite some overlap.

 What is a dusting attack?
 From Gemini...
  
A dusting attack is an attack in which a trace amount of crypto, called dust, is sent to thousands ‚Äî sometimes even hundreds of thousands ‚Äî of wallet addresses. This attack is deployed in order to track these addresses with the hope of ‚Äúun-masking‚Äù or de‚Ä¶</p>

                <p>Anytime we have 20-50% gains I sell a small portion of profit and reinvest. I‚Äôve tried buying and selling weekly/monthly on lows and highs. Overall it‚Äôs better to find projects you like long term and accumulate. I wait for price targets and buy. I wait for sell targets and sell. It‚Äôs easy. Don‚Äôt panic just stick to the plan.

                <p>Generative models have become synonymous with convolutions and more recently with self-attention, yet we (yes, I am the second author of this paper, yay üôå) ask the question: are convolutions REALLY necessary to generate state-of-the-art quality images? Perhaps surprisingly a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a couple of clever tricks does just as good (if not better) as specialized convolutional architectures (StyleGAN-2) on 256x256 resolution.

                <p>Noob here. I have very basic skills in Python using PyCharm. 
 I just picked up Python for Data Science for Dummies - was in the library (yeah, open for in-person browsing!) and it looked interesting.
 In this book, the author uses Jupyter Notebook. Before I go and install another program and head down the path of learning it, I&#39;m wondering if this is the right tool to be using. 
 My goals: Well, I guess I&#39;d just like to expand my knowledge of Python. I don&#39;t use it for work or anything, yet... ‚Ä¶</p>

 In general how much years of experience do you need to go from my current level to a senior data scientist and then to the principal/managerial level?

Researchers will submit their hypothesis (or lack thereof) and chosen method of manipulation (p-hacking, HARKing, cherry-picking etc).

 I‚Äôve narrowed down the careers I could be preparing for to Artificial Intelligence and VR/AR.
 I understand for VR/AR you would need to learn C# and Unity, but my goals would be to get a job developing iOS apps for Swift, then expand my knowledge into VR/AR tech (ARKit).
 On the other hand, I can spend my time learning calculus and probability, machine learning, deep learning, and other AI tech with Pyth‚Ä¶</p>

                <p>Just a few weeks ago, everyone was ecstatic. Ethereum was going to 10k, Bitcoin to 100k, Doge was gunna hit $1
 And then one tweet collapsed the entire market. Still down ~50% from ATH.
 And it‚Äôs funny too. We‚Äôve had massive adoption since then. Real governments are adopting Bitcoin.
 It‚Äôs legal tender in El Salvador. Colorado might accept taxes in crypto. Iran is even looking into it. Texas is encouraging miners. 
 But here we are staring at charts with red candles. Zoom out. We are living through history.‚Ä¶</p>

 Crypto is not a hedge against inflation, it is a hedge against them! Don&#39;t forget it, it doesn&#39;t matter what coin you believe in, üòâ we can all agree on this

 How do we send money to inmates?
 Currently, in the US, there are 2 ways, 
 1- Western Union and we all know that this have insane fees
 2- Jpay, the most commonly used that usually takes 1 to 2 days to transfer the money but it can be up to 10 days! Fees are up to 11$ for a single transfer + credit/debit cards fees. This is not right.

                <p>This whole thing makes no sense to me. It seems that news of bitcoin adoption; El Salvador, banks storing assets, states accepting bitcoin plus the fact there are tons of news about it, more companies experimenting etc... isn&#39;t doing anything. 
 The price isn&#39;t going up. 
 What is causing this struggle? Is it covid, what&#39;s happening with the dollar, any SEC things, or is it China again...? 
 Just hoping to get a good thread started with what people, news, thoughts and opinions.

 Heuristically, here are my general conclusions:

                <p>Probably not a popular sentiment here but I&#39;m trying to bring some rationality to the conversation. In the past year, the M2 money supply (which isn&#39;t even really quite all the USD there is) has gone from just under $18T to just over $20T. $2.3T has been &quot;printed&quot; in the past 12 months. It&#39;s a 12.8% increase. 
 But around 8M new Eth are created each year. There was a supply of about 108M a year ago. That&#39;s a 7.4% increase but that remains pretty constant when the USD rate is typica‚Ä¶</p>

                <p>Today, I learnt that only ~60,000 users in our subreddit have moon vaults active. That&#39;s only 2% adoption rate based on the 3 million users in our subreddit. 
 This is quite surprising since it&#39;s a subreddit based on cryptocurrency and it&#39;s opportunities. 
 It&#39;s free cryptocurrency that can actually change your life. One may even call it a low cap gem. Why miss out? Go and set up your vaults!

              <summary>What is "Einsum" equation ?</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>It‚Äô an elegant way to perform matrix or vector manipulation.
 I find it‚Äôs extremely useful if I have to perform matrix multiplication of matrices which is of higher dimension, it gives a great flexibility to sum and multiply among certain axis.
 Ex : if you have to multiply matrix A of shape (1,200,2,32) &amp; matrix B of shape (2,32,32) and results in a matrix C of shape (1,200,32).
 This can be implemented as follows:
 np.einsum(‚Äòabcd,cde-&gt;abe‚Äô,A,B)
 That‚Äôs it !

 Hi, I used a feed forward neural network on Keras to approximate a concave one dimensional function , I would like to find the argmax and the max of my neural network, what would be the easiest way to solve this ? Should I implement something myself or does Keras already have some buil in function for that ?

                <p>Not going to write a very long rant.
 Is it normal for you to do other people&#39;s work? Even though they are working on that day (they are not on vacation or anything). And the work is not like doing their tasks, but re-doing what they did because they are just working to get paid at the end of the month with 0 passion about understanding why they are doing it?
 Just wondering...

                <p>I wrote a quick Substack post about AI and the music industry - highlighting Jukebox by OpenAI and potential applications/implications. Would be interested to hear what those working in AI think of the potential impact and use cases within music and entertainment.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>I remember seeing in the headlines ages ago, that some researches found a way to crack text based captchas.
 Does anyone have any links to repositories or other code for how they implemented it?
 I would like to implement one in Python!

 Thanks!

              <summary>Imagine living in El Salvador and having Elizabeth Warren tell you that using Bitcoin will destroy the planet. Then consider the energy used by US banks, the US military, and the US government, all to protect a US dollar that aims to destroy every other currency.</summary>

                <p>There are some policy ideas I agree with Elizabeth Warren on, but her statements on Bitcoin yesterday were so laughably stupid.
 It made me think of her analysis of the final season of Game of Thrones, which she called ‚Äúsexist.‚Äù Now, there are some good critiques of the way the show ended, but that was an example of Warren just hopping on some bandwagon of internet outrage. Probably never even watched GoT. Her thoughts on Bitcoin are equally ignorant.

 21 years ago I was in a business school for programming. I was On my way to barnes and noble to pick up a C++ book when I heard on the radio Barnes and Noble stock flash crashing to a $1 from about $25-$30.

                <p>BTC is somewhere around $15 but you have no knowledge of future pricing. How bullish does this headline make you? Is it too far out there or are you selling your kidneys? Considering how BTC was being mined back then I would probably invest in a dialisys machine first.

 They&#39;re both watching the world move on and evolve past them.

 They should be afraid. All politicians should. 
 There&#39;s now something out there They can&#39;t take control of.
 It&#39;s beautiful!

 Now I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one but - although causal models are the holy grail, due to time and cost and laziness constraints all my models are just association models, not necessarily causal but observational in nature.
 Easy, so I then communicate the associative nature of model and no DO operator or intervention has been modelled at all. E.g. recently and elasticity model i modelled observed price % change against qty sold % change. But then business takes a mental leap and wants to use they mode‚Ä¶</p>

 Is a multivariate Cox regression model appropriate for this problem, where the &quot;event&quot; is the product being sold out? What about if the items can be restocked (i.e. by users issuing returns), effectively increasing the stock in the process?
 Is there a more sensible approach? I tried to look up something like ARIMAX for non-negative + discret‚Ä¶</p>

 &quot;Don&#39;t. It&#39;s trash. Bivariate (one independent and one dependent) models don‚Äôt tell you much other than confirming if there is a strong correlation.&quot;

                <p>I know that knowing databases is crucial in this area but what is about more advanced topics like scalable databases?
 Keywords would be: Hadoop and MapReduce, Spark, parallel and distributed databases, Data warehousing
 This is an advanced course on databases at our university so I wanted to know how important such knowledge is if some one is lets say working as an ML engineer/data scientist.

 I&#39;m building a tool that asks personalized follow up questions in order to get detailed survey responses. It&#39;s powered in part by GPT-3 (created by OpenAI). If you&#39;re open to testing it, it takes a couple of minutes...and I welcome feedback.
 It&#39;s imperfect, but that&#39;s why we&#39;re testing ;) Please DM me for a link!
 I&#39;d also love to hear your experiences building standalone AI products like this.

                <p>This account exists because I want to provide this space with meaningful insights. My latest contributions were solely focussed around IOTA. I received accommodating and friendly responses from in and outside of the IOTA community which is the reason I keep going as there is obviously demand for these kinds of analysis. Interestingly, after my last two articles around IOTA, I saw people asking for Cardano.

                <p>I&#39;m sure whoever it is, is already aware and it is our fault (an incredibly rare bug caused it) but if you could return the Lumens we&#39;d really appreciate it. We haven&#39;t taken any profit from the site at all yet and it&#39;s only going to reduce the pool balances for the next time you want to trade so please consider it. 
 It was 2554.5 Lumens that we accidentally double sent.
