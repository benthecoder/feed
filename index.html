              <summary>Most onerous data formats?</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Hello, 
 I am looking for some suggestions or ideas surrounding the most onerous and irksome data formats you’ve had to work with. Here’s the skinny: a very large, and in my humble opinion, just straight up malevolent company X is conducting retaliatory data requests at small public offices and institutions in a US state. One of my friends happens to work there. Now, I am all for free and open public data, 100%, but this is a nefarious attempt to drain and waste public resources and to intimidate. They are …</p>

                <p>I&#39;m interested in a side project that looks at grocery store shopping habits and health outcomes. For the shopper history, I was hoping for loyalty number-based transaction data that would give me a good picture on how &quot;healthy&quot; their trips look. I&#39;m not as interested in price as much as types of food (i.e. fruits vs candy). Haven&#39;t come across how to buy these data, but this tweet thread made me think a data aggregator may have it. Has anyone purchased grocery shopper transaction data…</p>

                <p>I have a dataset that is pre-computed into a distance matrix, fully connected between all points. This made sense as it was originally intended for clustering but now I am wondering if I could use it for classification, i.e. given unlabelled points and their distances to all labelled points, assign soft labels. Being able to do regression in the same manner would also be a plus.
 I tried Googling this but I could not come up with the appropriate terms to search. The best I could find is graph-based semi-sup…</p>

                <p>I read an interesting article on Medium that claims the Data Scientist title will go the way of the dodo in a decade. 
 The TLDR is: data science tools will become as ubiquitous as MS Office products, and everyone will be expected to be skilled in using them. Titles will transition back to reflecting domain knowledge rather than skills will data.
 What are your thoughts? Do you agree? Will this impact how you approach your career path?
 It reminds me of Chandler making a lot of money for simple data entry. …</p>

 I&#39;ve always been under the impression combing both is largely unnecessary and their use depends on the business or the individual data scientist&#39;s preference.

 AI is an accelerator of evolution. 
 AI makes us seriously ask the question of what it means to be a human.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Façade was a text based 3d interactive story game where you try to talk to a couple and resolve their issues, you can say essentially anything and they will have some form of response to it. The game is however really old and it&#39;s very inaccurate at understanding you most of the times. 
 I was wondering, are there any newer games like this? We have come so far since then in terms of AI, so there ought to be possible to make a game like this.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>I recently noticed that some cryptos have huge subreddits but relatively small market caps, and vice versa, so I decided to compile some data on the top 100 cryptos by market cap to see which coins have more or less support vs their market cap. 
 For each $1B in market cap, this data shows how many subscribers each coin has in its respective subreddits. Note that this doesn&#39;t include things like stablecoins or outliers like WBTC.

Bought more Ethereum in the bear market of ‘18-‘19, and never traded or sold until a few weeks ago when my portfolio hit the milestone I committed myself to. 
 Finally got the notification from the loan provider today that it’s paid off in full, and I can’t even describe the relief! (Of course the banks &amp;amp; provider took a few weeks to process the payment haha).

 Upon my return to civilization I check again and all my coins are pretty much at the same value they were before my trip.

 First week:
 We are in the middle of a bull market. Look at all these charts. It will 100% go on for a long time.
 Second week:
 Elon is manipulating the market.
 Alternatively: Elon isn&#39;t powerful enough to manipulate the market.
 Beginning of third week:
 This is just a small dip, because we are still in a bull market.
 End of third week:
 This bear market will go on for a while for sure and BTC will hit 2…</p>

It&#39;s easy to get swept up in the panic when everyone is talking about how the bear market is here, coins are going lower, etc. &quot;Next stop btc 20k!

 Don&#39;t put yourself through the mood swings. Get off reddit, go down to the pub and wait for it all to blow over.

                <p>I am using programs like node2vec, graph2vec, doc2vec etc to build a knowledge graph. The output of all of them comes in 128 length vectors.
 Is it feasible to try and compress the length to 2 or 3 dimensions so that I might visualize what any of the above methods have accomplished? If it it feasible than can I get pointed in the right direction for python libraries, packages, etc? Does not need to be perfect... just needs to give more than a csv file lol.

 Caveat: both of those were the first/top choice in the poll (as in, visually at the top of the list).

                <p>Hey guys,
 I recently got a position of a PO of a data science team. Previously I always worked with classic engineering teams. Needless to say, I quickly come to realize that 1) data science team != engineering team in terms of way of working and approach to work 2) I probably could use some development of how to be a better PO for such a team.
 &#x200B;
 What I would like to ask you guys about:
  
Could you recommend a good book / training / materials to become better in working with a data science team?

                <p>I’m wondering if I should stay a generalist (there’s always stuff to learn) or if I should hone in one niche area (NLP, computer vision, causal inference or bayesian stats)
 It seems like the ideal data scientist is an expert in all of those areas, even though in reality it’s quite difficult. We all sorta learn what we need depending on the problem we’re tryna solve
 Update: seems like most of y’all are recommending be a generalist unless I’m passionate about a specific area

                <p>I know most of you don&#39;t care about GME or are very sceptical. However this is about crypto and adoption. 
 Even if you don&#39;t care about GME, it was one of the most traded stocks for quite some time this year with Apple and Tesla. Now they are going into crypto and we should support adoption in anyway we can.

 But you don’t “have” to do anything. Sometimes the best thing to do is just turn off your phone/computer, and don’t do anything. 
 Just a reminder for those that need to hear it.

                <p>I could sell at a loss, but I&#39;m not going to. Right now the plan is to basically treat all of this as an extended cycle all the way to 2024, which is the next cycle start. All I&#39;m doing is just chilling, accumulating, DCA-ing. If I&#39;m not at my goal, I&#39;m not selling. 
 Weirdly enough, having this commitment has made it easier for me to sleep. I barely check charts anymore. 
 Checking every few hours counts as &quot;barely&quot;, right?

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>These last couple of years, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time writing SQL. I put together some lessons learned to use it effectively for Data Science projects.
 Small things like using CTEs, auto-formatting, and jinja have made a huge difference for me.
 What other recommendations you have to master SQL for Data Science?

                <p>The situation is like this: We receive deliveries of data electronically, and let&#39;s say they are expected to arrive at 8 AM daily. But historically they can arrive at say 5-10 AM. So it&#39;s periodic but not really. The data is gathered only hourly at the top of the hour.

                <p>I see this as an example interview question all the time.
 But I never see great answers.
 So far as I can tell, a good answer might be..
 - L2 norm is continuously differentiable
 - L1 has closed-form solution 
 -L0.5 or L3 are possible
 -but L3 norm will tend to overregularize and bring coefficients towards each other.
 -L0.5 norm would induce some irregular sparsity; not even sure how to clarify this one.

 Do yourself a favor and keep your investments for yourself, your mental health will thank you.

                <p>Hey guys, if any of you guys were waiting for a correction and aren’t buying at these prices, something is just wrong. Please don’t ask should I buy now? When bitcoin is back trading at 65k. You have the chance to buy rn, but won’t because you’re scared and hope we’ll drop more. We just had a 50% correction, and you’re hoping it’ll drop more. Don’t miss this great buying opportunity. Good luck and hodl strong.

 In the real world I also wonder whether cross validation for hyperparams can result in being more sensitive to things like data and concept drift. Because well if the future data doesn’t look like your validation set then…</p>

                <p>This is not financial advice
 If you FOMO&#39;d at the top, its ok. It might take awhile to recover, but it will eventually recover, and then some. DO NOT SELL FOR A LOSS. Crypto isn&#39;t dead, in fact its growing faster in just the last 4 months than anytime in its history.
 You will need to DCA over the next few months though. Last crash took 1 year to hit bottom, and 2 years to see green (from the last ATH). If you DCA, you will see green sooner than anyone who bought at the top and is just hodling.

 What’s going to happen and what should I do?
 Well, I read a lot of of analyses stating that they expect a BTC crash to 20k before the next 75k + bull run. How long will that be, no one knows.

 Well, this downturn is my time machine. It gives me a chance to DCA my way back in time a few months. Which is what I&#39;ve desired most. Even if this turns out to be a crash rather than simply a dip, the 2017/2018 crash recovered and mooned in 2-3 years. If …</p>

 It&#39;s important to know when to sell, It makes riding this craziness out so much easier.
 Buy when literally nobody gives a shit about this shit. Sell when your friends who never expressed an interest before reach out to you about crypto.

 TL;DR: The market is an overleveraged and rehypothecated bomb.

The repo market could blow up at any moment from a lack of collateral and short squeeze the US Treasury market itself. The entire m…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>I am currently a data scientist/analyst. My current job has a lot of analyses and code that could be functionalized and used as an internal Python package. I am interested in working in a role that is focused on creating packages, tools, and other processes to help streamline and create efficiency for an entire DS team... and less so a role that is actually DS itself. Curious if anyone knows if there is a certain job title that fits this description?

 I currently work in finance/banking as a bank regulator. It requires a lot of financial analysis and familiarity with banking.
 I do review bank ML models to flag fraud and stuff.
 Would completing this course open doors for me? What roles can I take on?

I’ve mostly been doing software development with Java and Python, which Is great too... I was just really looking to do more DS/DE since they are less abundant than SWE

 It was nothing fancy but it was insightful and I enjoyed it; now I want to expand my knowledge into SQL, but I am wondering if realistically so few people/places use STATA that I should start learning Python, or SPSS instead?

                <p>Hi everyone,
 I was scrolling feeds of the group and did a quick search for Knime. It actually surprises me how unpopular as a platform is considering that the last post was a year ago. 
 I have started to learn more about Knime (required for job) and wanted to see your thoughts on the platform based on the experience you had.
 Is there any substitute that does a better job than Knime and this is the reason why it is not very popular.
 Any opinion is helpful.

                <p>We’ve all seen this in one way or another, hell maybe some of us has exhibited this ourselves in the past. 
 I’ve had friends and family tease about crypto back in 2018 after the crash when just weeks ago they were curious and were talking about how they wish they had taken advantage of the opportunity before it blew up. Though when this opportunity re-presents itself, they run for the hills. This is repeating itself now and it’s only a fraction of what happened in 2018.
 It’s not easy sticking to your guns…</p>

                <p>It is amazing to me that a country can pull the same stunt three times, and have it work every single time. China has &quot;banned&quot; crypto in different ways three separate times. In 2013, 2017 and now in 2021. They are doing this in order to manipulate prices downwards, for better buy in prices for themselves. 
 If china really wanted to ban crypto they would have done so already. They have a massive vested interest due to their bitcoin miners, all they are doing right now is manipulating the price for…</p>

For string type input data, it is common to encode categorical features using StringIndexer first.
  
In what situations would I want to take the extra step of transforming StringIndex&#39;ed output to one-hot encoded features? I can find a lot of resources on how to use which, but not in which cases the OneHotEncoder would be better.

To top it off when I let them know the %% I am up for the last year they seem to lose interest. Freaking people man!

Researchers from Google recently published a paper where they got state-of-the-art results in panoptic segmentation (see below for intuitive explanation). They achieved it by combining information about depth, existing and new objects from two consequent frames.

I read that both have the same 11th gen intel chip, also the same Intel Iris Xe Graphica cards, but dell xps 2021 has intel evo while surface doesn&#39;t. I currently have a surface pro 3 (so old!!

They are interested in the final product (not on the code), and since I would be using some personal libraries of mine, on the one hand I feel that being too fast is counterproductive with an hourly rate (= little money). However if I just set a flat price and there&#39;s unforeseen issues, I might have to work more,…</p>

                <p>If you believe in crypto you are in it longterm. For those that are exiting, just know you would have never held until now had you bought at sub dollar prices.
 You can only beat the algorithm and high frequency traders if you hold longterm. Crypto is a long play.

                <p>Some people may have jumped too quickly to comparing now to the end of 2017, and forgot we had several big crashes in the middle of the bull run. Some also around 40%.
 Keep in mind that Bitcoin had only gone 3x the previous bull market&#39;s ATH ($19,500) so far in this bull run. At the end of 2017 it had already done 15x. So it&#39;s hard to imagine that this bull run would end this soon.
 In the last bull run, Bitcoin had gone 3x in the summer of 2017, then had a big crash in July.

 Fuck you. This is disgusting. SHIB is a scamcoin and you are preying on newbies that don&#39;t know any better to FOMO into this. Yeah most ppl have adblockers, but especially newbies might not be that &quot;tech-savy&quot; and won&#39;t have one. I&#39;m even fine with DOGE advertisements even tho I don&#39;t like the coin. But SHIB is a scam. At least I believe that&#39;s what the consensus is. Glad I&#39;m not trading with that site. Clearly unprofessional.

 Other teams tend to take credit for the reports, models, and any other analysis we do. This lends to our team apparently not adding business value to the company and makes it more difficult to do salary raises, promotions, hiring, etc. Another i…</p>

 All this is to ask if you folks know of any mentoring networks that I could join.

 This is a 2018 article, anyone can confirm whether this philosophy continues at Netflix? Any other companies out there doing this?

                <p>Be careful about misleading news of China banning cryptos. It&#39;s just reuters manipulates the market.
 From Qiao Wang&#39;s twitter;
  
3 dumb things happened within the last hour: 
 1-Reuters writing a misleading article on China banning 
 2-People retweeting Reuters and believing it 
 3-Market dumping on the Reuters news 
 China didn&#39;t just ban crypto. It&#39;s reiterating an anti-speculation law from years ago.

                <p>TLDR: Under PoW, as the price of ETH and the hashrate are positively correlated. Therefore, as as the price increases, in equilibrium so too does the power consumed by the network. Under Proof-of-Stake, when the price of ETH increases, the security of the network does too (the value of the ETH at-stake is worth more), but the energy requirements remain unchanged.

                <p>A crypto chart is nothing more than a picture of human emotions. Painted on the canvas are the emotions of greed, fear, hope, and euphoria. As a disciplined trader, you capitalize on the psychological demons that plague other traders.
 Simply HODL. Longterm strategies are best to beat algorithm and high frequency traders. Invest money you can afford to lose or not have access to for a few years. Weekly ups and downs don’t matter anymore. And then you can stop looking at the chart entirely.

                <p>You heard it before but they keep getting bigger. DO NOT YOLO INTO THOSE SH*TCOINS. Don&#39;t let the awards and the people in the comment sections trick you. They are mostly bots or paid people (not sure if they are paid but it is clear that someone told them to advertise it). The only real people you&#39;ll find are calling out these bs or genuinely newbies that are confused. If you want to gamble and take the risk, fair enough but these are mostly scams.

                <p>I got into crypto in the crab market last summer - Bitcoin was ~$9300 and a movement of $200 in either direction was a spectacle. Crypto spaces were dominated by technical discussion. Debates were about the viability of proof of stake instead of the character of billionaires. Right now it feels like emotion drives the discourse and while often compelling, it’s a waste of time. There’s a lot of excitement entering the space.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>One comment upvote is worth one karma, which is 0.48 moons. (at least this month with double comment karma) moons are 10 cents so one upvote is 4.8 cents. One single click, which can be initiated by anyone with a free account and access to internet is worth almost 5 cents. This is higher than the minimum hourly wage in some countries. Sierra Leone for example has a minimum wage of 3 cents. It really puts things in perspective for me when you think of it that way.

I&#39;m still wondering if we humans can overcome the rise of A.I and the likelihood of them taking over.

 DSs train models, do exploratory analysis, create variables, validate hypothesis, but don&#39;t put any of that into production themselves.

                <p>I split this investment into 5 parts, and yes, some of it was Bitcoin. I also have the promise to not change my mind in a week, because of any coins carbon footprint since I’m aware most technologies rely on some form of energy.
 With that promise in mind, may I now change my Instagram bio to crypto entrepreneur and visionary?

                <p>No one can predict the future and I am just some random guy on reddit, but I suspect these will be the lowest prices you&#39;ll see on some of the bigger cryptos for a long time and a great time to sell some stuff so you can get more. Personally I am selling my Nintendo Switch, my entire collection of Warhammer 40k minis, and my golf set and splitting the profits between BTC and ETH. It&#39;s true that my quality of life will be slightly decreased for a little bit but I think I&#39;ll be happier in the long…</p>

                <p>When I first started crypto, every time I sold the market spikes, when I bought the market dipped.
 I&#39;ve liquidated all my personal assets and bought some BTC. I will soon sell to pump the market and sacrifice myself for you all.

                <p>Last month same time, ETH was somewhere around $2500. 
 A lot of us were practically checking the charts every few mins just to see its progress. 
 Oh how happy I would&#39;ve been if someone would&#39;ve told me that exactly a month from now we&#39;ll be nearing $3k. 
 But today, when its actually happening, its the complete opposite of what me or anyone of us would&#39;ve thought. 
 Oh how the turn tables.

 I was 25 when the 2007-2008 financial crisis hit. I had a great thing going. Married the woman of my dreams and was about to have a kid. Well the insurance brokerage I worked for went belly up. I was staring unemployment in the face with a kid on the way. I was sc…</p>

                <p>Some might be asking why is this important. There is a difference between trading crypto, selling crypto, even using crypto in their systems, all different from crypto being on record as a bookmark for assets as proof of wealth. My loan officer had my companies, my portfolio, my properties, even my collectibles on record to keep my lines open and to open new ones, but crypto has never been allowed, can&#39;t even make a note of it, once it is allowed, and THIS should be what excites you, once it is allowed,…</p>

                <p>Hey everyone,
 I’ll be honest I find this community a bit like the boomers of crypto. There’s a lot of complaining and just negativity at times, I hope this community fixes that.
 With that being said, what I’m about to post actually has me concerned.
 So we all know about shitcoins, nothing wrong with them. Think of it as OTC or Pink sheet stocks. Most are shit but you may land a few diamonds in the making, maybe.
 Now my concern is with SafeMoon. It has received a huge popularity due to intense marketing.…</p>

Try to take this as a chance. Take a look at coins with massive potential after this dip
 Do some Cost Average and buy at a lower price.

 How to avoid this and forever be in the green pastures?
 Simple as hell, just go to your trading app settings (e.g. Binance) and change the color pattern so that the green color represents losses and red color to represent gains.
 Congratulations, you are now forever in the green.

If you spell it with 2 &#39;O&#39;s, that&#39;s a different word. Loose and Looser and loosing are what your butt muscles do during a crypto dip. Lose, Loser, and Losing is what your wallet is doing. See the difference? It&#39;s just so incredibly important for these next few days and weeks that everyone gets this right, because we are all in this together.

 So I’m lolling at all the people who have commented that I’ve “flinched” because of how I’ve been trashing Elon (which I did on the way up too) and how I should have “covered myself better.”
 Lol. I’m up 450% still lifetime in crypto, and that’s with BTC at 42k. That’s after buying ethereum at the tippy top last cycle and watching it drop to $90.

 In the chart below we can see Bitcoin outpacing the 2016-2018 cycle. Several mathematical and economic theories suggest that this shouldn&#39;t happen. You could call what&#39;s happening unsustainable growth—growth that is influenced greatly by external forces: COVID-19, mass fiat printing, institutional involvement, and social media influencers among others.

              <summary>What laptop specs are needed for deep learning?</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>I’m running an old macbook 8GB ram and i5 processor and it’s a nightmare for data science now but does the job for data analysis.
 I want to upgrade but not sure what the most important thing is in a new laptop. I think building a Lenovo Thinkpad makes the most sense but what should I go for in terms of processing power, RAM and GPU?

                <p>Hey everyone, I first posted this on r/analytics but realized it doesn&#39;t fit very well there. I need to scrape some elections data from a website. It has JavaScript and around a 1000 individual pages that all have the same format and variables, stored in a table. I&#39;m new to scraping but have read a bit today and it seems like Python is my best bet. I was wondering if this is the type of thing I should use a full crawler on, like Scrapy.

                <p>Why bother mastering SQL when you can simply extract all of the data using a few basic SELECT commands and then do all of the data wrangling in pandas? 
 Is there something important I’m missing by relying on pandas for data handling and manipulation?

                <p>I am currently looking for a way to detect if a conversation is occurring. The meaning of the conversation is not important for this case.
 One approach that seems viable is to try to detect a voice that is not the user’s voice. This would most likely work for my purposes. So, does anyone have any resources that can identify whether the voice belongs to a specific user or not?

                <p>Does anyone know a bit more about this, and potential ways that it can be addressed? For a project, I just need to think of an idea of how it can be addressed by some kind of project (though we don&#39;t need to fully design it or anything, just the idea).
 I was thinking of something about data cleansing, word embedding, but I don&#39;t know too much and am not sure how to tie it together.
 If you have more background info about related aspects, that&#39;d be extremely helpful, thanks!

And there were certain limitations associated with autoregressive methods like ELMo and GPT as well. XLNet was introduced to get the best of both worlds while at the same time not include their weaknesses.
 In continuation of my Paper Notes series, I have written an informative summary of the paper. Personally, reading the XLNet paper was a very fun experience. I was amazed at every step, how they were including stuff to ma…</p>

 Grayscale, Microstrategy and PayPal are still buying, Tesla is searching for a integration of a power efficient cryptocurrency and almost all major banks are creating a crypto/Bitcoin fund. This is just a pullback like all others. We&#39;ll be back to $60k in 2 weeks - just zoom out :)
 Enjoy these &quot;dippy days&quot; and see it as a healthy correction as well as a great opportunity to buy more

Soon after you invest, things are actually looking okay and this optimism you feel remains with you. But then things suddenly change and the market just plummets without no forewarning to you.

 If you felt like it was a good investment a week ago, it&#39;s still a good investment now.
 The price of your holdings in the short term are mostly speculation.
 Over the long term, the price will revert to its fundamental value (i.e. what it&#39;s actually worth).

                <p>Some fast facts for you regarding wealth in the US:
  
Even if you have $0 in net worth (i.e. no savings/assets but also no debts -- or they cancel out in value), you&#39;re at least in the 28th percentile for net worth in the under-30 age bracket.
 To be better off in terms of net worth than most households under 30 in the US (top half/50th+ percentile), you only need a net worth of $7500 or more.

 It&#39;s true what they say, &quot;Time in the market, beats timing the market&quot;. So don&#39;t over-leverage, don&#39;t sell high or on the way down, and stick to projects/coins you believe in.…</p>

 Im seeing so many Elon hating posts and it’s really annoying. Back when Elon was repping Bitcoin everyone here was super happy. Now that he’s repping Doge (or anything but YOUR coin) he’s the worst thing ever. Be happy he’s even repping crypto in the first place.

 Elon Musk replies that he wants to speed up Block time 10X and increase Block size 10X to reduce transaction fee 100X, for Doge Coin.

 This is a follow-up to an earlier post comparing Bitcoin&#39;s previous cycles to today. Credits to u/Mutchmore for the initial idea. The chart compares the market cap among all cryptocurrencies relative to time. It uses a logarithmic scale, meaning the growth is proportional (i.e. the growth of $1 to $10 is equal to the growth of $10 to $100). The 20-21 market is green, the 17-18 market is red.

 &quot;what are the best coins under $X?&quot;
 And sure, it looks like that makes sense - Bitcoin (BTC) is super expensive already, while a coin like BitTorrent (BTT) is available for less than one cent! If you buy some now and they become as expensive as Bitcoin you will be rich! Bitcoin also used to be cheap! Right?

 If you saw a project on a new grads resume which is basically a song recommendation system for Spotify, would you think its a good project or bad one? I only ask as I see many projects with the same premise and I want to know if its been done to death already.
 I&#39;m really interested in the project but I don&#39;t have time as I have to start preparing for job interviews soon and I don&#39;t want to waste time doing a project which won&#39;t help me get an interview. Any thoughts and advice…</p>

                <p>Currently I’m in my third year of my bachelor data science. I’m planning to graduate next year after I have done my graduation project. There is the possibility to do this at a company, and I so happen to find an application for an internship data science at a profesional football (soccer) club, with the possibility of doing a graduation project there. Since I’m unsure whether they would provide me with a project, and the application is rather vague of what the intern would exactly be doing, I’d like to go …</p>

 I just love me some data is all. So I reposted saying that I meant it, and then the organiser thanked me.
 I am just too hard core. Data data data. Nom nom nom.

 In one specific case, we give applicants data to work on for take homes where Machine Learning cannot be applied due to inherent limitations of the data. But almost 9/10 we get candidates who…</p>

 I am in talk with a recruiter for an exciting position in a fully remote company (well funded startup and recruiter promises a good work-life balance). I have had colleagues in the same location in all the places I worked before- I very much enjoyed the social aspect of office. So being in a fully remote team is something new for me and I am being a bit cautious.

                <p>Hello,
 I&#39;m new and working on a logistic regression model. I have two variables that are (what I would consider) abnormally large at 10.2 and 30.7. I read online that it&#39;s usually a bad sign if this is the case and that this may signal multicollinearity. However, the VIF Factor on these is 1.2 (for both) under the 5.0 that I&#39;ve read signals multicollinearity. Is it OK to leave these in? Should I remove them? Thanks.

                <p>You will never make money if you don’t BUY THE DIP. That’s how the market works. If you sell the dip, it’s the same thing as starting a business to charge customers less money than what the product cost for you. Resist the urge to panic sell, the crypto market is not going anywhere! It’s here to stay and it will always rise up again.

              <summary>With this most recent distribution, 44 people maxed out their karma to receive 3,570 Moons each. Let's look at how they did it.</summary>

                <p>I always do this privately at the start of every Moons distribution, for just a couple of users, but just to see if I can put my finger on the pulse of the subreddit. It&#39;s funny to see the older distributions where meme posters got the lions share of the moons and how that changed. Anyway.

                <p>I’ve now seen many people, including the ceo of Binance, comparing bitcoins energy consumption to energy usage in the current financial systems. This is stupid.
 Companies like visa process many multiples more transactions than bitcoin, it’s ridiculous that people are comparing these systems as a whole.
 When you compare the energy usage per transaction bitcoins real problem is shown.

I enjoy my work but spent much of my time in school learning Data Science (ML, Deep Learning, Data Analytics). I’m trying to decide if diving into Data is worth the risk of leaving my comfort zone. Has anyone here made a similar transition or can anyone offer insight on whether or not this is a good idea?

              <summary>Coffee chats - what's your preferred way of requesting networking connects? LinkedIn / Email / lunchclub?</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Tried lunchclub, horrible experience - didn&#39;t have a single conversation of 10+ scheduled chats. Considering reaching out to folks on LinkedIn, but would love to know if there&#39;s a smarter way to do this, like some active discord channels. 
 P.S. with all the reform talks going on, would be worth opening a discord server or slack channel for the sub as well.

 He stirred up the hype with BTC with insane and unsustainable leap. Then created the meme mania with Doge which gives rise to shit/scam coins. And then just like that ... he decides to FUD on BTC ... and Doge. Please remember Doge is a fork BTC, it inherits the same PoW, environmental impact. So he propped up Doge for months and now he FUD on Doge too.

                <p>I feel that the biggest exchange listing a shitcoin like Shiba with such a stupid description and lack of use case was greedy and irresponsible to begin with, this dump and the way it came about does not reflect well on their listing criteria. 
 I know they can do as they like with what they list, but listing things like this definitely lowered my opinion of them. 
 I salute VBs move. I do sympathise with some of those who got burned, but that is the risk of shitcoins ladies and gentlemen.

                <p>Julian Barbour’s obsession with time began on Oct. 18, 1963. The 26-year-old Cambridge graduate in mathematics was on a train to the Bavarian alps, where he and a friend planned to climb the Watzmann, Germany’s third highest peak. The newspaper in his hand contained a summary of a Scientific American article by British physicist Paul Dirac. “He questioned whether four-dimensional symmetries are a fundamental feature of the physical world,” Barbour recalled.

                <p>It seemed inevitable that Elon Musk would eventually get into a Twitter war over whether Mars can be terraformed. When you’re on Twitter, he told Businessweek in July, 2018, you’re “in meme war land.” “And so essentially if you attack me,” he said, “it is therefore okay for me to attack back.”
 Musk, the CEO and lead designer of SpaceX, wants to “make life multiplanetary,” starting with Mars. “Public support for life on Mars is critical to making it happen,” he tweeted last week. The red planet is relativel…</p>

                <p>In the late afternoon of May 5, SpaceX’s Elon Musk tweeted, “Starship landing nominal!” Musk is not known for understatement. But seeing that stainless steel behemoth soar was, for many, something more like phenomenal. Over 5 million people watched the spectacle on YouTube, perhaps many with bated breath, as every prior attempt at landing Starship had gone up in flames. Not SN15. This Starship, after having climbed 12 kilometers and then coasted down in a “belly flop” configuration—using its wide silver bod…</p>

                <p>Applying Deep Learning techniques to complex control tasks depends on simulations before transferring models to the real world. However, there is a challenging “reality gap” associated with such transfers since it is difficult for simulators to precisely capture or predict the dynamics and visual properties of the real world.
 Domain randomization methods are some of the most effective approaches to handle this issue. A model is incentivized to learn features invariant to the shift between simulation and re…</p>

                <p>I’m looking to see if there is a data science &quot;category&quot; that focuses on physical phenomena (i.e. physics, math, chemistry etc) instead of data science methods used when analyzing human behavior (like voting tendencies or purchasing habits). I know that both areas can use the same machine learning models, but I&#39;m curious to know if the physical sciences tend to benefit from a certain &quot;category&quot; of data science methods.

                <p>Hey guys, doing some work for a seminar and need to give an introductory presentation on Bayesian networks. Do you guys have any sources you&#39;d recommend that had accessible, intuitive, or overall &quot;useful&quot; (however you define that) introductory explanations for Bayesian networks? I have two already:

 In this picture here, it appears that the survival curve for &quot;male&quot; patients seems to descend steeper than the survival curve for &quot;female&quot; patients. Based on this information, could you argue that in this example, males are at higher risk of experiencing some unfavorable &quot;event&quot; (e.g. let&#39;s assume that this example is about surviving some medical condition) and therefore should be initially paid more attention to compared to …</p>

                <p>Seriously, I see posts every day about how people are spending crazy amounts in fees trying to withdraw off Binance, Coinbase, etc. Gemini literally pays this for you 10 times each month.
 I&#39;ve saved literally hundreds of dollars using Gemini instead of other exchanges to buy BTC and ETH. Sure, Gemini doesn&#39;t have the greatest coin selection, but that doesn&#39;t mean you should lose a significant percentage of your trades to withdrawal fees on blue-chip crypto in the space.

                <p>Hi everyone, I am back with another long one! 
 &nbsp;
 As someone with a masters degree in Financial Economics, I have seen many theories over the years, and quite frankly, since last year almost all of them have been proven useless in the real world. Maybe useless is the wrong word, but since the pandemic, the market has not made a whole load of sense theory-wise.

 However, there is one theory that I want to highlight today, as it appears to be more relevant than ever in the cryptocurrency market…</p>

                <p>Since buying my first tiny amount of Bitcoin in February, I have been checking my crypto portfolio constantly. It&#39;s basically the first thing I do when I wake up, and the last thing I glance at when I sleep. I check it while I eat lunch. I check it while I take a #2. After getting stressed out about the ups and downs, I decided I have put my money in coins I believe in and I would stop constantly checking it.
 Well now it finally happened. I haven&#39;t looked at my portfolio in the last 36 hours or so(…</p>

 Often when talking about Cardano a comparison is drawn to Tezos and how Tezos is way ahead of Cardano.
 Which got me thinking, why don’t we talk more about Tezos here? How come we hear so much about Cardano instead?

                <p>The most recent Bitcoin halving took place on 11 May 2020, a year ago today. Bitcoin itself was priced around $8,500, with market dominance around 67%. Eth was around $185... what a difference a year makes!
 However this growth isn&#39;t entirely surprising going by the Bitcoin cycle - the Bitcoin halving event has instigated a bull market on three occasions now.

 I am looking for the best universities that provide machine learning online master degree and provide a certificate with no difference than on site studies.

 I&#39;m thinking about exploring DS in the freelance world. I have started working full time in January, but the position is not very challenging or time consuming and I need more projects. I&#39;m wondering if anyone out there has any experience as a freelancer, consultant, or part-time and what your tips are to be successful? 
 Thanks!

 EDIT: and would anyone else be interested in seeing this sub be more than a flood of career entering and movement threads? If that&#39;s what is wanted great, but I&#39;ve always thought that most of the content in this sub could be contained in a single pinned thread.

                <p>ETH went from around 4150 to 3600 in 15 minutes, I&#39;m guessing a whale dumped a ton of ETH and the new traders started to freak out and thus the panic selling began. But Oh My God, not even 15 minutes later ETH is almost at 4000 again. 
 I must say I am really impressed, even for crypto I&#39;ve never seen anything like it. Sadly I missed it, would have bought more. ETH is so incredibly bullish right now.

 It’s just whales making up for their loss, preparing their bags to invest in stocks that just dipped, pumping it back up and putting that money again in cryptos.
 It’s alright, discount for us

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>In a polarized nation, victimhood is a badge of honor. It gives people strength. “The victim has become among the most important identity positions in American politics,” wrote Robert B. Horwitz, a communications professor at the University of California, San Diego.
Horwitz published his study, “Politics as Victimhood, Victimhood as Politics,” in 2018.1 He focused on social currents that drove victimhood to the fore of American political life, arguing it “emerged from the contentious politics of the 1960s, …</p>

                <p>Last year, my first in medical school at Columbia University, I used a bone saw to slice through the top half of a cadaver’s skull, revealing a gray brain lined with purple blood vessels. This was Clinical Gross Anatomy, the first-year course that has fascinated or devastated (or both) every medical student. You never forget the day you open the skull.
Cutting into the brain, unlike the muscles of a forearm or the arteries running down a thigh, feels personal. As a cloud of aerosolized bone dust particles d…</p>

First the ROV travels through the productive sunlit waters, rich with fish and jellies, but as it sinks the light fades, and all that’s left of the sunlit zone are sinking bodies and waste of the creatures above, raining down so softly, and so densely, scientists call it “marine snow.” Then as the snow fades,…</p>

The universe bets on disorder. Imagine, for example, dropping a thimbleful of red dye into a swimming pool. All of those dye molecules are going to slowly spread throughout the water.
Physicists quantify this tendency to spread by counting the number of possible w…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>My friend Robert Burton, a neurologist and author, wanted to share a song with me last year, and sent me a link to an NPR Tiny Desk Concert. “It’s wonderful to see truly new and inspiring music,” he wrote. I clicked open the link to a band who appeared to have journeyed from their mountain village in Russia to busk for tourists in the city square. Three women wore long white wedding dresses, thick strands of bead necklaces, and Cossack hats that towered from their heads like minarets of black wool. They pla…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>In his Theaetetus, Plato remarks to Socrates: “This pathos is proper to the philosopher: It is the thaumazein. And philosophy has no other point of departure than this.” The word, which contains the root thauma, the same that appears in thaumaturgy, has often been translated as “wonder.” Philosophy is born out of amazement mixed with the curiosity that arises from facing something inexplicable that fascinates and transcends us. Aristotle writes explicitly that, beginning by asking the simplest questions, hu…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Many marine biologists identify a gateway drug into their obsession, and for Heather Koldewey, it was the seahorse. Who can blame her? Seahorses seem to have evolved not entirely in the ocean, but also by way of a whimsical storybook, in which animal body parts are all mixed up. A fish with the head of a horse? A male that gets pregnant, gives birth, and is monogamous?
Seahorses led her not only to her career as the head of marine and freshwater conservation at the London Zoological Society, but to her effo…</p>
