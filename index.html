                <p>I posted on Blind recently that I was looking for something new and I got a few responses saying they would refer me to some big name tech companies (such as FAANG and FAANG adjacent.) Some seemed legit, but some after DMing them I got a few very similar copy paste responses, almost down the exact wording. It made me a bit skeptical and I was wondering if anyone here has ever gotten interviews via this method and how reliable it is.

For example: My manager would tell me to analyze why this week&#39;s cycle time for a factory increased. So I&#39;ll get the data from the sql database and then use Python or R to go deeper and see what type of manufacturing parts caused the increase in cycle time and then give the results to my manager.

 I’ve recently started a side project at work that involved text classification, naturally, I went to look at NLP packages on python and found gensim.

 I am not actively looking for a job but time to time I search for it and apply if it aligns with my experience. Whenever I search for Data Analyst positions especially in big cities, I see the search results shows mostly Data Scientist role or few Data Engineers. 
 Has anyone else felt this or I need to search better? (Not sure what that means)

 Lifelines, Convoys, and Scikit-survival do a good job of showing how to draw survival curves in Python, but they focus exclusively on Matplotlib, sometimes to the point of hard-coding Matplotlib-based convenience functions.
 This tutorial shows how to draw survival curves with Altair and Plotly (Python) based on a Lifelines Kaplan-Meier model.

                <p>Pokémon do work in the real world and are transacted digitally in either centralized exchanges at a pokecenter or P2P via trades. Pokeballs are just cold storage wallets. 
 The in-game currency is more a basic game mechanic than it is in-game currency as we know them today. Items are cheap af and your characters earns far more than enough just by advancing the plot. The only true commodity in the game is Pokémon and they are traded with much more utility, value and scarcity.

 Is this an elaborate plan to encourage the masses to hold fiat and sell their assets, so that the rich elite can buy the quality assets at a better price? 😹

 There is no such thing as a Bitcoin, an Ethereum or any other “coin”.
 Many people are under the erroneous impression that there are such things as atomic units of ‘coins’ that are moved from address to address and can therefore be tracked on the public chain. I think this mistake has its roots in language and analogy.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Right now AI research is blossoming, with all kinds of fantastic results being published every week.
 But does anyone worry that when AI tools become powerful enough, governments around the world will crack down on it heavily and essentially prevent the general public from using it? I&#39;m imagining a world where people are trading model weights on flash drives because AI models are essentially outlawed or classified. 
 Is this just science fiction, or should we be planning ahead for such a scenario?

Why not to use a free game engine to build an environment, generate loads of precisely labeled data and try to train a network on that? Afterwards, if the virtual environment is realistic looking enough, we could try transfer learning to pip up the model on real photos, or even use it right away.

 For the first question the JD is more a general JD for any DS/DA role, the only thing is the domain industrial knowledge I&#39;m more familiar. Not sure if it could be the answer.
 Skill needed would be DE, cloud computing....

It would be great for something like a hackathon where I wanted to do something with low code and quick, but for learning purposes I feel like it does a lot of work for me.

The team is inspired by a formal equivalence between today’s linear transformers and 1990s fast weight programmers (FWPs), and so has proposed recurrent FWPs, i.e., RFWPs.

                <p>This approach has been adopted by a few projects lately (including polyyield today) so I thought I&#39;d warn people about it. Its similar to a rug pull/exit scam/ what ever else you want to. call it. 
 The protocol (lets say ShitSwap) launches with regular farms where everything seems to be fine, and accrues volume and TVL gradually, everyone is earning their income and the project earns people&#39;s trust and a community forms around this project. This is the precursor to the scam.

 Then let&#39;s rewind uptil a few days ago, the sentiment is COMPLETELY opposite. I&#39;m seeing people say &quot;crypto is done&quot; and that &quot;crypto is a scam&quot;, and posts like these being upvoted. People I&#39;ve never se…</p>

 It&#39;s been bothering me to think what a waste of time it will be and stuff I&#39;ll have to do to alter my whole routine. The fact that I literally don&#39;t interact with anyone all day and just do my job is making me realize what an overkill it is to go to the office.

                <p>Hello All!
 I have a question regarding transaction matching algorithms. 
 I received a data-set and the records consist of one side of a two sided trade. The goal is to match each trade record with its correct counter-party based on a few categorical and continuous fields.

 John Chen, Blackberry CEO, wrote these words in an open letter to all Blackberry users in 2014. The company was in a downward spiral, losing market share to the likes of Apple and Samsung. Yet Chen saw no reason to press the panic button.
 His open letter stresses the importance of staying true to yourself. It remarks that words like “innovation” are often carelessly used.

 My boss ask me to make a codebook about a project we have been working on. The problem is that he wants to codify a question that reads like this &quot;Describe what you think about X in three words&quot;. Is there a way to pipeline this? I use R and Stata and doing this word by word does not seems useful or doable. 
 I hope I was clear in my question.

 Deployment - the model is exposed through an API

 I am getting married to my fiancé next June and her father passed away a couple years ago leaving her without his presence there on her special day. She has a ton of voicemails from him kept on her computer she listens to sometimes.

                <p>In my opinion, apple fans who praise apple because iPhones have years of support while telling android users that android phones are not good because they only get 1-2 years of support is nothing but stupid. Lets take the idea of security for now and focus on apps. Apps can extend what a smart phone can do, and without apps they don&#39;t do much but text and call. Some iphone users talk like android is bad because phones on that side only get 1-2 years o support rather than 5+ years. Thats actually stupid …</p>

 The amount of steps required to use layer 2 solutions or things like TLM and WAX are just so damn high and everyone along the way takes a cut. 
 This isn&#39;t how crypto is supposed to be. Currently, instead of paying one central party, there&#39;s a dozen different parties all wanting a share.

Plus I never invested any of her money or more than I could afford. All that good stuff. But for a good 5 months or so I was giving her pretty constant updates, because good lord is the bull run exciting and I wanted to share it with someone.
 Anyway, just a funny thought I had.

                <p>A day ago a post on r/bitcoin showed the immensely high amount of bitcoin shorted, this of course sparked discussion on whether bitcoin would drop below 30k. However, now we see a huge amount of bitcoin being covered: https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDSHORTS/
 Crab market? Bear market? Bull market? Who knows, but the shorts seem bullish (for now).

                <p>Most people will only go buy Bitcoin when it’s hyped, rather to buy it when the price is good. (Same reason when people didn’t buy BTC at 500 dollars in 2014, and skipped the chance to buy it at 9,000 dollars in 2018.) Will you regret today’s 30k? Yes you will... You will come to this same sub after 5 years and question yourself on why you didn&#39;t buy 5 years ago.

                <p>In a spur of the moment thing, I told my family that I own a bit of Crypto during a family Christmas get together. They looked at me like I had just told them I shoot up heroin under a bridge. My far relative took my dad to the side and told him to find a way to get me out of it before it&#39;s too late.
 I remember getting rock hard over 5% stock gains in 10 days. Thanks to this sub, I know to stay silent at family gatherings and not look down upon my uncle who holds a glass of whisky in his hands with a s…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>I honestly cannot think of a coin that was anywhere near this high of market cap and plummeted so much. Yes, one can argue ICP launched just as a bear market started, but hardly any coins in the top 100 by market cap fell anywhere near this amount. ICP is a true outlier.

 Peter Saddington of Atlanta first read about bitcoin in 2011, and bought some for less than $3 per coin. With bitcoin trading at around $7,500, the return on those early investments is around 250,000%. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” says Saddington, 35, an entrepreneur who has a bachelor’s degree in computer science and three master’s degrees. “What solidified my confidence that this is worth investing in is that the code is based on math.

Googling crypto brings a heaping pile of FUD, rando price predictions, and mommy-blog style opinion pieces that don&#39;t do anything to educate you. Wikipedia only gives about a kindergarten level of education. And it seems like everyone who&#39;s interested in informing you is just inviting you into their echo-chamber of shameless shilling.

                <p>This is my understanding of the situation. Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but the math seems pretty clear. I know I&#39;m not the first to state this, but I feel like this issue has largely been hand waved away with the store of value narrative, and with El Salvador attempting to use it as a currency it may be a rude awakening to the major flaws with the network.
 The Bitcoin network can support about 7 transactions per second.

 I recently purchased AIMA to self-study but have found it difficult to remain motivated without anyone to discuss it with or to hold any way to hold myself accountable. I was wondering if there was anybody in a similar situation, or even anybody that wants to start reading it, that would also find it beneficial to pair up virtually or go through the textbook together?

                <p>Deepfakes have become increasingly convincing over the years. In collaboration with Michigan State University (MSU), Facebook has presented a research method of detecting and attributing Deepfakes based on reverse engineering from a single AI-generated image to the generative model used to produce the image. The technique will allow deepfake detection and tracing in a real-world scenario, where the often the only information available for deepfake detectors is the image itself.

Voter participation is rarely enough to meet the decision threshold
 There is confusion about how and when to propose or vote on polls
 Governance Polls should be treated equally

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Anyone who has been in crypto during the past two bull markets wil tell you that one of the biggest mistakes you can make is not formulating a profit taking strategy ahead of time.
 When markets go parabolic you can&#39;t make rational decisions, the hype will distort your views of what&#39;s possible. You end up never taking profits and holding through a crash, and losing all your gains. Also, if a dip happens you&#39;ll be prone to panic selling and can miss out.
 Now is the time, when markets are flat or…</p>

On a popular view about meta-ethics, what you should value is determined by what an idealized version of you would value. Call this view “idealizing subjectivism.”&nbsp;
Idealizing subjectivism has been something like my best-guess meta-ethics. And lots of people I know take it for granted. But I also feel nagged by various problems with it — in particular, problems related to (a) circularity, (b) indeterminacy, and (c) “passivity.…</p>

 Buying low is great for obvious reasons especially if you&#39;re trying to DCA down after buying high but be careful you don&#39;t fall into a trap of thinking that everything that has crashed will come back up and especially up to where it was previously.

 I&#39;ve even done some things I won&#39;t mention here. I&#39;m not gay, but 20,000 Satoshis is 20,000 Satoshis.
 Now it&#39;s looking like we really might hit 20 K in the coming weeks. And I need ideas for even more…</p>

 What is crypto?
 Cryptocurrency is decentralized digital money, based on blockchain technology. You may be familiar with the most popular versions, Bitcoin and Ethereum, but there are more than 5,000 different cryptocurrencies in circulation, according to CoinLore.
 You can use crypto to buy regular goods and services, although many people invest in cryptocurrencies as they wou…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>This is one benefit of the market crash: you can save yourself a bunch of money through a perfectly legal tax loophole.
 All you need to do is create a capital loss. This means you sell crypto for a lower price than you bought it at. For example: If you bought one bitcoin at 60k, and you sell at 30k, you just locked in a capital loss of 30k.
 So why is this important? Because capital losses cancel out capital gains. Since the wash sale rule doesn&#39;t apply, you can instantly buy back your crypto and the l…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>XLM, a decentralized cryptocurrency with fees so low you can send 1000 transactions, costing a cent. Along with its supply cap of 50 billion, meaning more cannot just be “printed”. Yes, I get there are competitors like NANO, but even then I still don’t see it widespread. Some people may say that this is a stable coin in some instances, and well, it’s both a good and bad thing. You can hold XLM without much worry about it crashing a ton overnight, but it still has its volatility.

 Is this valid or is there something I am missing?

                <p>I am in the market right-now and I see that many companies are asking for gitHub url information- I&#39;m assuming it is so that the interviewee can provide some work that they have done on the side in ML (outside of work requirements) , so how important is that? Because I enjoy ML and data analytics as my job but after work I enjoy other activities, not necessarily doing data analytics and projects in ML. So is not having a gitHub full of ML projects something frowned upon by employers now?

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Hi all,
 I recently came across the original Tidy Data paper (if you haven&#39;t read this, check it out- I wish I had a long time ago) and have been thinking a lot about how to best reorganize data from my experiments to make analyses and visualization easier. However, my datasets seem kind of unconventional and I haven&#39;t found great examples for how to best tidy them.
 Basically, I continuously collect rodent behavioral data in sessions that span 60 trials. I collect timestamps of events of interest (…</p>

                <p>Okay so China banned mining. It kind of fucked us up, but look at the bright side. They can&#39;t ban it again, causing another crashes. The miners are moving to another countries (Thank you for decentralizing mining, now a power shortage in China or other bad news won&#39;t hurt as bad). That&#39;s one source of FUD less. All the bigger dips we had i believe were related with &quot;China banning crypto&quot;, maybe now they will leave us alone. Hope we will see a proper bullrun with all the good news we ha…</p>

                <p>Couple of days ago (15/06/2021), one of the largest Bitcoin whales sold 1500 Bitcoins just before the dip of the past days. (Source: https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/block/687612/1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ)
 Now, they bought back 1062 of these Bitcoins, just probably before the market goes up again. (Source: https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/block/688437/1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ)

 The GBTC purchase was made via the actively managed ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW), and as of yesterday GBTC is now the ninth-largest holding inside of ARKW at 3.62% of the fund. Wood and team also added just shy of $50M of Coinbas…</p>

                <p>It’s hard to argue with the famously authoritative Oxford English Dictionary, but its definition of physics as the “branch of science concerned with the nature and properties of non-living matter and energy” is incomplete because physics studies living things as well. Physicists reported biological research at their first international meeting in 1900, and physics and math still help biologists understand living things.

                <p>Disinformation manipulates accurate information deliberately to mislead the masses, and the spread of such information is not new. It has been in practice for quite some time, right from the imperial war propaganda and now in this digitalized world. Social media has brought with it its perils, and one of them is its usage to spread false information. It has the power to change opinions altogether, for example, the entire dynamics of the public elections. However, it is now being claimed that artificial inte…</p>

                <p>Hi, I am an undergrad with a background in neuroscience and math. I have been very much interested in the problem of AGI, how the human mind even exists, and how the brain fundamentally works. I think computational neuroscience is making a lot of headwinds on these questions. Recently, I have been perusing some ML labs that have been working on the problems within cognitive neuroscience as well. I was wondering how these fields interact. If I do a PhD in comp neuro, is there a possibility for me to work in …</p>

 What does it take to do this in a budget friendly way? (no vendor lock-ins or proprietary software licenses as much as possible) 
 It has to have automated, scheduled replication (using CDC/bin log).
 Alternatively, can you suggest an easy to manage olap dwh other than clickhouse?

              <summary>For those living in Japan/for those who would know: What is the state of the data science field in Japan like? I heard there is a huge demand for data scientists there.</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Hello guys,
 I saw from this post (two years old) that robotics, NLP, and AR/VR were quite big in Japan. I was wondering if that is still the case? What other additional data science/AI fields are picking up over there? 
 Additionally, I read that there &quot;aren&#39;t many good formal educational opportunities to learn data science. &quot; Is that still true? 
 Lastly, would people in Japan be interested in data science presentations by speakers from Canada and/or the states? 
 Thank you for your time!

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>So I vaguely understand what Spark does at a high level. 
 Right now, I&#39;m working as a data analyst. All I do is write SQL queries, conduct exploratory python analysis, build tools, etc. 
 I don&#39;t really do heavy analysis, ML, etc. 
 If my company transitioned to Spark, what would be the impact for me? I would have faster processing times for my SQL and Python Scripts? Access to real time data, rather than waiting on ETLs?

                <p>I have 40k time series from roughly the same distribution (daily product sales over time) and I need to forecast how each will behave.
 How would you approach this? Retrain a really basic model 40k times? Or have a huge model that is trained once with all the data?
 How fast would the prediction work? I mean if it takes 10 seconds for each of the time series, 400k seconds is... a few days :(

                <p>Does anyone else feel this way are is it me? Granted I don’t have a crazy 7 figure amount in. I got in this knowing it was possible I could lose most of my money. I don’t get scared about everything going red. I get scared of everything sky rocketing green and not being able to do the smart thing and not get greedy. I do have a “plan” when things start going up again but this is what bothers me more than seeing red.

                <p>I am a newbie researcher in economics with AI focus. I have read several systematic review studies that looked into AI-driven tools from other papers. What made me confused is that there are so many systematic reviews that included the papers using technologies like e-health, telemedicine without claiming to embed any AI technology in such papers. I feel like the authors overclaimed or made heavy assumption of &quot;AI&quot; to get their papers noticed, or maybe I am wrong.

 Does anyone have a recommendation for a big dataset containing 30+ columns and 30k+ rows? Or perhaps point me in the right direction where to find a dataset with those criterias?

                <p>Are statistical models in theory able to make predictions about individuals? Suppose you have an individual with observed covariate information (x = a, y = b, z = c) : in theory, can a regression model (trained well on some data) predict the expected value of this individual&#39;s response variable?
 I heard today that statistical models are not designed to make predictions about individuals. They are only designed to predict the average behavior of a large group of individuals - and in theory, should not b…</p>

                <p>Hello,
 I&#39;m working on a project with a client that has sensitive data. He would like me to do the analysis on the data without it being downloaded to my computer. The data needs to stay private. Is there any software that you would recommend to us that would make this done nicely? I&#39;m planning to mainly use Python and R for this project.

                <p>Hi. Some data science job ads, mostly of data engineering type want &quot;at least basic knowledge of linux&quot; or &quot;user knowledge of linux&quot;. A while ago I read a post somewhere on reddit describing what that could be but now I can&#39;t find it. 
 Looking at https://linuxjourney.com, the most recommended linux tutorial on reddit, will I be fine after completing the &quot;Grasshopper&quot; level, or is it more like that I should finish the whole course and then I have basic knowledge since I hav…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Hi all!
 I&#39;m hoping you can help me scrape data off of this web map: https://fortress.maptive.com/ver4/66ac434516a4ac2808f0c63f1469ac50
 I haven&#39;t gotten too far, but it looks like the data are loaded by POST requests and come back as JSON. I think a local web server might be needed to do this, and it&#39;s a little above my paygrade. If anyone could point me in the direction of some resources, or is able to say &quot;Oh this will take two minutes, do this!&quot; I&#39;ll be so grateful.
 Thanks so …</p>

 Table headers are a mix of English, French, and German. Data is mostly measurement data (imperial measures) and fractions, in a courier-style font of the typewriter era.
 I know I have to OCR all this but I can’t find a tool well suited to tables of data. Let alone engineering notations.

 That is over $5bn in assets per employee of Tether
 If that seems comically low it&#39;s because it is. It&#39;s a world record for total amount of money managed per employee. 
 The only similarly small number of employees for such a large amount of money under management was Bernie Madoff&#39;s ponzi scheme which had $50bn under manageme…</p>

                <p>Let&#39;s say you bought $100 worth of MATIC at $2. Then MATIC dropped to $1 and you bought $100 worth again.
 What&#39;s your average now?
 If you think it&#39;s $1.5, don&#39;t worry, you are not alone. I know 2 friends who said the same thing.
 You have a total of 50 + 100 = 150 MATIC.
 With a total investment of 200$, your average is 200/150 = $1.33
 Now you only need to wait for it&#39;s price to go up 33% before breaking even.

With each ban there was naturally less and less effect on the actual market. But it looks like recently the Chinese went all out with their crypto ban hammer on all levels (so conveniently coinciding with the final stages of the Digital Yuan launch).
 For a long time, Chinese controlling Bitcoin and it&#39;s hashrate, was a leading FUD of the opponents of Bitcoin in general. Well…</p>

 Even though these things are banned in China, they are thriving in the rest of the world.
 If China wants to crackdown Bitcoin mining activities, miners will go elsewhere. This is actually a good thing for cryptocurrencies, as it shouldn’t be under a decentralised, power-obsessed regime. China can play with its digital yuan.

 Personally i think there is little to no point doing TA on any crypto in a market so controlled by the current BTC price action and also so volatile and sensitive to whales.

                <p>I&#39;m a CS student, I understand some very basics but I&#39;ve never taken a course on anything related to Machine Learning or AI. The example I&#39;m going to use is a Netflix &quot;recommended for you&quot; machine learning algorithm. My assumption is that the algorithm takes in a bunch of data values e.g. Title, Genre, Length, Actors/Actresses, Producer, etc.
 Let&#39;s say the only content I &quot;like&quot; on Netflix are comedy shows and movies, and I like hundreds to thousands of them on Netflix. I…</p>

                <p>Did you ever want to see what you look like as an anime waifu? Thanks to the authors of GANs N&#39; Roses you can animefy (pretty sure this isn&#39;t a real word) selfies and even videos with a multitude of unique styles. The authors from the University of Illinois propose a new generator architecture that combines a content code computed from a face image and a randomly chosen style to produce consistent, diverse and controllable anime faces with attributes matching the content image.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>After much thought, I have decided that getting a masters in data science is the correct career choice for me. I begin my studies this fall, and my first class is python for data analysis. 
 Does anyone have advice they’d like to share? I know the basics of Python and I took an online udemy course for Python with data analysis back in 2019. 
 My goal is to maximize what I learn in this course because I’d really like to increase my use of Python (for data science and just in general)

                <p>Within Australia, large companies have something called grad programs. These grads rotate through the business 3 or 4 times in 6 months stints. These grads have to apply to an area of the business to work. I need to write a pitch to get these new grads to apply to my area of the business.
 Question is, if you are new to analytics/data science, why did you want to get into it? What did you hear about it for you to think yeah that’s what I want to do?

                <p>First one you enter too late. You probably heard about people making crazy returns on the news or from some of your friends. 
 Second one you’re still greedy and inexperienced. Probably take profits too early or wait till it’s too late, don’t know how to recognise a top. 
 Third one you already enter with loaded bags and take healthy profits along the way. You realise when the market is cooling off and exit accordingly.
 Experience matters guys.

                <p>Hi,
 I have a dataset containing the monthly number of shipments for the years 2014 to 2019. I used the Facebook Prophet algorithm to fit a basic model. However, I am not sure how to implement cross-validation on this data. I could not find any blogs/GitHub files that perform cross-validation on monthly data. Is there a workaround for this?
 Thanks in advance

                <p>I know that GDBT model cannot be parallelized during training because the trees are built sequentially. What about its scoring / making prediction phase for one single sample? 
 As far as I understand, we can evaluate the outputs of all trees at once (hence parallelizable), and the final prediction is just a linear combination. Is that correct?

 I setup a short survey print(https://forms.gle/2XGL3q8RGpZjmLi78) to learn more about problems that other developers (data engineers, data scientists) face when it comes to documentation. It would help me out if you&#39;d be willing to give some feedback about the challenges that you face. This is a problem that I face when working on new projects and on new teams and something that I want to build and solve for.

 Could I get your opinions on the best value data science bootcamps out there? It&#39;s something I&#39;ve looked at for a long time, but I&#39;ve been hesitant to pick one because there seems to be so many of them.
 The first one that comes to mind is General Assembly, and I also see Springboard. Let me know your experience with these and any others out there.
 Thanks in advance!

                <p>I’m a beginner and I’m planning on creating a career in cloud services. I currently have little to no knowledge on cloud platforms and I am wanting to learn more. As a first step I’m planning to prepare for the basic certification offered by AWS I.e. Cloud Practitioner. It would be great if anyone can provide me resources to begin with. I’m more of a video person than book person so if you have any online MOOC course that will be perfect for my goal. Thanks!

Hi all,
 As per the title, I&#39;m planning to learn to write code, with the intention of becoming more involved in the growing world of crypto, and more specifically DeFi. I&#39;m taking a guess that there might be other people wanting to do the same and so thought I&#39;d propose a kind of mutual motivation study group.

 Mid-tier holders with wallets holding from 10 to 1,000 BTC are not flinching either.

                <p>Autoencoders is a kind of neural network where the yield layer has a similar dimensionality as the info layer. In less complex words, the quantity of yield units in the yield layer is equivalent to the number of info units in the information layer. An autoencoder reproduces the information from the contribution to the yield in an unaided way and is hence here and there alluded to as a replicator neural network.

                <p>I often see in textbooks and blogs, when dealing with Bayesian Models, popular choices of priors seem to be well-known distributions (e.g. the gaussian prior). But how would you go about selecting priors for a specific model?
 For example, suppose you are interested in making some bayesian model (e.g. for causal inference) on some medical data. One of your variables - &#39;smoking status&#39;, you have knowledge that patients who smoke vs patients who don&#39;t smoke have different life expectancies.

                <p>I am currently a sr. analyst doing research on business questions and support our DS team as a SME. It&#39;s a fairly relaxed but unsatisfying job. The pay is ok but enough. We will have hybrid model when going back and the commute is only 10 minutes.
 I went to my (grad) school networking event, pitched myself to a company, and got offered a managerial role. My responsibility is building out data solutions such as dashboards, analytics, and ML models, in addition to overseeing a small data process/ETL team…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Most of the stock price prediction tutorials use a single stock as example with LSTM models. Although stocks have been proved to be random walks and containing to use LSTM for real time predictions is &quot;not recommended&quot;.
 Say that you stuck to LSTM, how does it happen in real world for 10 different stocks (it could be 20,50, etc.)?
 Do you train 10 different LSTM models? Or use a different approach? 
 The Idea is to tell which amongst these 10 stocks would rise and which ones will dip.
 Thanks

                <p>I have a couple projects I’d like to work on. But I’m terrible at holding myself accountable to making progress on projects. I’d like to get together with a handful of people to work on our own projects, but we’d meet every couple weeks to give updates and feedback.
 If anyone else is in the Chicago area, I’d love to meet in person. (I’ve spent enough time cooped up over the past year.)
 If you’re interested, PM me.

                <p>Honestly, if there is anything that will speed up adoption of crypto, it’s the crooked banks. We live in Germany, we’re we are now being charged 11 bucks monthly to even own a checking account. Not to mention the constant micro fees for every freaking single action taken. Every year I get a bank statement with all the fees from the passing year are listed. In 2020 I spend $700 USD on fees! In the mean time, my bank is building huge extravagant offices and paying their Executive brass millions in bonuses.

 If you are active in crypto-related subreddits you&#39;ll soon notice a (understandable) misconception:
 New users tend to think that their coins are stored in their wallet. Therefore, they ask questions like: &quot;what happens to my coins if I delete my wallet? How can I move my voins to my new PC etc.
 I find it necessary to stress the follwing fact:
 Your wallet does not hold any coins. Your coins are not stored in your wallet

                <p>Not really a big fan of Warren Buffett, but I think this quote describes perfectly how wealth is accumulated....and it&#39;s why everyone is here. No offense to the traders here, but the goal isn&#39;t to be sitting in front of screens making the right timing decisions...it&#39;s to be letting assets you own accumulate. So congrats for being here and starting on that path...

 Once you&#39;ve done that, save yourself a potentially MASSIVE headache in the future and backup your 2FA. Ask anyone who has lost their primary device how much of a pain in the ass it was to get their access back to all their crypto accounts and you&#39;ll realize why. Most authent…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>I want to promote a healthy discussion where everything isn’t 100% the best or 0% the worst.
 So I’ll kick off with Bitcoin - the common knock on it is that there is “no utility” and “environment impact is poor” etc etc.
 (I am not a Bitcoin investor FYI) but my rebuttal to that would be:
  
a store of value is utility in and of itself. If there’s a critical mass of holders at a certain value on a finite resource (as there is with gold for instance) whilst there may be short term price volatility the lack o…</p>

                <p>Ok, I&#39;d like to start out by stressing that this is not meant to be a shitpost.
 r/Bitcoin had us beat. We surpassed them by 50-100K I think. 
 Obviously that means moons are the poor mans bitcoin. A place to talk about crypto generates tons of traffic. Being the number 1 in that department means this subs own crypto is in it&#39;s early stages of exploding.
 Obviously. Anyone who can&#39;t see that has 1 braincell left, and they just killed that reading this. Moons will moon.

                <p>Hi all! For those who didn&#39;t see the post yesterday (not a lot did!) I have been compiling a list of terms that are used in crypto with some basic explanations of what they are. The purpose of this is to have a way to explain the terminology without scaring people off. I&#39;ve watched many people try to explain crypto in real life to have the recipient start to gloss over - usually right around when the word blockchain, or decentralized, or mining for hashes come up.

                <p>Megatron-LM provides a simple yet innovative approach on how to parallelize models to train large (multi-billion parameters) language models and efficiently use GPU memory during scaling. The key point is that it does not require any major modifications (like compilation or an entirely new framework) to implement this in the existing code. It also suggested a small modification in the BERT architecture which allowed BERT to scale effectively to parameter sizes that did not perform well on before.

In the fall, COVID cases drop to 10% of their current level. You’re back to working/studying in person. You’re vaccinated, as is everyone else.

 1 - Everyone’s a genius in a bull market. Real traders can survive and even thrive in bear markets or highly volatile markets.
 2 - Don’t be a blind bull. ALL markets are cyclical. Don’t be afraid of pullbacks or market crashes – that’s where you can make the most money.
 3 - There’s a big difference between a trade and an investment.
 4 - Fully plan your trade before you pull the trigger on the entry.

                <p>Too many people treat this like a casino or like the latest r/wallstreetbets stock play. Crypto is a long game. People that bought the peak in 2017 had to wait three years to break even, it&#39;s not always a quick process.
 Don&#39;t get me wrong, if you buy crypto you will make a significant amount of money, you just have to hold long enough. 5+ years should be your timeframe.
 Big gains in crypto require diamond balls and years of holding.

 Alt-seasons are defined as a short-term burst in valuation that outperforms both Bitcoin and its respective historical trends. A famous example of such can be of May 2021&#39;s alt-season, where alt-coins like Ethereum outperformed and hit short-term all-time-highs of 4k (Fig. 1), although different exchanges may vary with exact numbers. These alt-seasons, summarized, are caused by market momentum that disturb cash influx, causing substantially higher amounts of cash to flow into alt-coins.

So far I&#39;m doing some SQL and basic calculation for reporting. Usually I will need the feedback from senior ones to double check, but only after the final output is ready, which is not really efficient.

                <p>Hi,
 I have worked with R as my primary language dealing with everything from econometrics/ML applications, GPS analysis using APIs, NLP contract analysis and dealing with unstructured data. I would say if I have a problem and can use R then I can likely devise some way to solve it.

 However, I want to move into a new role and I am finding despite my 5+ years with R as my primary language that Python is more preferred when I talk with recruiters, so I have picked it up and I was hoping to get some…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Suppose you have a predictive model that has been used for a few years - at what point do people decide to make changes to the model (e.g. add new variables, retrain the model with new data)? Is there a standard procedure for doing this? Are old and new models often run in parallel? 
 I would be curious to hear how this problem is being handled across the industry.
 Thanks

What I really should do is model the team ability as a random walk in time, or add some sort of competition/tournament effect. The model is good enough for me for now.

 In February, after Tesla bought $ 1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, Barra said her company would evaluate bitcoin acceptance.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Hi all,
 Title says most of it. 
 Whenever things start to dip, I see a lot of people around here post the phrase &quot;buy the dip&quot;. They&#39;re right, it&#39;s a great buying opportunity. 
 Always keep in mind though, it&#39;s possible for the dip to dip, and you&#39;ll want to have some fiat leftover incase that happens.
 TLDR: Buy the dip, but have money leftover incase the dip dips.

The “Dataome” Is Huge
The dataome is shorthand to describe all of the externalized information we generate in symbolic representations: drawings, music, books, computing, data storage. It’s all of the information we utilize and propagate, along with ourselves, through time and space. It’s not encoded in our genes but it’s clearly heritable.

                <p>One of my favorite albeit heavily paraphrased quotes from Albert Einstein is his assertion that the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible. (What he actually said, in his 1936 work “Physics and Reality,” is more longwinded, and includes a digression into Immanuel Kant and the meaning of “comprehensibility”, but he does write “... the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.”) In truth, this statement holds back a little.

 Sorry if this is a weird question. I’m entering my senior year of college as an Econ/stats major and I’m really curious as to what skills I’m learning at school will actually be used in real life. I work a lot with excel, R and Stata doing summary statistics, linear regressions and transformations. Does that basically sum up this field?

So why did Lee Sedol, probably the greatest human Go player in the history of the game, feel the need to quit just because there was an AI that was better? Obviously that is his right, but someone please explain his reasoning beyond his simple &quot;I am no longer the best&quot; explanation which is obviously lacking in closure for many of us ...

I know we can look through our trade history and write it all down on a spreadsheet or something, but this looks like something that could’ve been easily implemented by Binance. I’m trying to see my BEP ffs.
 It’s a pain in the ass to record every single purchase, especially for those looking to DCA up or down.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>What do you think about a cluster analysis to segment customers? I feel like a manual segmentation is often times better, especially when it comes to more personalized marketing. 
 I think that clustering makes sense when there are distinct groups in the population. However, I think that these groups can easily be identified by EDA (finding thresholds of certain variables) in most cases.

                <p>Hey Guys,
 I am currently working on my thesis. In this thesis I work with time series data and use a model based on fused regression estimated on a rolling window. Unfortunately I do not habe enough obervations to utilize cross-validation or even any kind of validation. If someone here could point me on something I could use instead to choose my hyperparameters I would be incredibly thankful.
 Thanks in advance and have a nice day.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Hello everyone,
 for a university project we were given the following simple algorithm and I was wondering if it has a name or is similar to an existing method. I&#39;d be glad if you could leave some comments.
 So we have data points with 2 features in 3 evenly distributed categories. One can easily see 3 clusters but there is quite some overlap.
 The suggested method wants us to determine 3 centres, one for each category, and categorize data points by determining the closest centre. These centres should b…</p>

                <p>Hey all,
 If you&#39;ve ever had your wallet dusted before, it can be pretty confusing. &quot;Someone gave me free money!&quot; you may think. Like everything in life, there&#39;s no such thing as a free lunch. 
 What is a dusting attack?
 From Gemini...
  
A dusting attack is an attack in which a trace amount of crypto, called dust, is sent to thousands — sometimes even hundreds of thousands — of wallet addresses. This attack is deployed in order to track these addresses with the hope of “un-masking” or de…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Anytime we have 20-50% gains I sell a small portion of profit and reinvest. I’ve tried buying and selling weekly/monthly on lows and highs. Overall it’s better to find projects you like long term and accumulate. I wait for price targets and buy. I wait for sell targets and sell. It’s easy. Don’t panic just stick to the plan. 
 NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.

In short, a woman got people to pay for investment education and some future promise for her coin that would overtake bitcoin... and then pocketed the money and hasn’t been seen since. 
 What was it like being in the crypto community when this happened? Did anyone here buy into it? Was there an actual OneCoin blockchain or was it all fraud?

                <p>I wanted to provide a picture of her story, but unfortunately you cannot post pictures in this sub. Bassically, Kim Kardashian just promotted a shitcoin called ETHMAX on her instagram story with the premise of being a good coin because half of the supply was burned recently. Frankly, I&#39;m surprised the people behind this coin had enough money to pay her for this promotion. What do you guys think about this?

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Generative models have become synonymous with convolutions and more recently with self-attention, yet we (yes, I am the second author of this paper, yay 🙌) ask the question: are convolutions REALLY necessary to generate state-of-the-art quality images? Perhaps surprisingly a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a couple of clever tricks does just as good (if not better) as specialized convolutional architectures (StyleGAN-2) on 256x256 resolution.

I just graduated a year ago in May 2020 into the pandemic and I was hoping by now I would have found something in line to my degree. I went to a public college in-state and major in Analytics and Intelligence so I have the basis of many of core things in data science.

 I assume theirs multiple different types of tabular data.. sequential is anything with a time series such as audio, &amp; image is a 2D picture is that all their is?

                <p>Just venting my frustration with the current US tax law in hopes that, maybe, we can some how begin a movement big enough to change it.
 It&#39;s so frustrating that some of us have to liquidate a part of our current investment holdings, and thus, lowering our overall future ROI, just so we can pay someone who risked none of his own money his share of the pie.
 I am all for paying taxes. It&#39;s only right that we pay for the safety and conveniences that our country have given us, but taxing crypto to cryp…</p>

                <p>I don&#39;t have the exact stats here, but if I remember correctly, bitcoin went through about 7 major corrections during the last bull run of 2016/2017. Or maybe that was during the last halvening cycle. Anyway, let&#39;s focus on the corrections rather than the timing: Each of those corrections was at least 30%. Some were in the range of 70-80%, and a few have been close to 90%.
 I think we&#39;ve just gone through another one of those crashes. 
 &quot;Wait,&quot; you say. &quot;It only dropped about 50% …</p>

 I just picked up Python for Data Science for Dummies - was in the library (yeah, open for in-person browsing!) and it looked interesting.
 In this book, the author uses Jupyter Notebook. Before I go and install another program and head down the path of learning it, I&#39;m wondering if this is the right tool to be using. 
 My goals: Well, I guess I&#39;d just like to expand my knowledge of Python. I don&#39;t use it for work or anything, yet... …</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>I&#39;m a new grad MS working as an entry-level data scientist. Most of the PhDs at my company are either at the senior level or managerial, but most also have a few years of experience too.
 In general how much years of experience do you need to go from my current level to a senior data scientist and then to the principal/managerial level? I know a few new grad colleagues in SWE who got to senior engineer shortly after one year, but it seems like that trajectory is not exactly the same for DS.
 I know this…</p>

                <p>Science is facing a replication crisis. I am calling for the preregistration of studies. Specifically, which questionable research practices the researchers intend to use. Researchers will submit their hypothesis (or lack thereof) and chosen method of manipulation (p-hacking, HARKing, cherry-picking etc). Completion of preregistration will guarantee non-publication in participating journals. There should also be a similar process for industry.

 Not sure if this post violates the on-topic rule, it is DS-related in the applied sense in terms of being a practicioner, sorry if it is considered OT.
 I usually work locally on my machine, which has always been a laptop with an i7 or i9 with a lower-end nvidia GPU for small to medium-sized modeling tasks. I&#39;m going to start a new job soon and will have my choice of work laptop. Big compute tasks can be performed on the cloud, however for prototype/POC work with limited datasets that don&#39;t req…</p>

 How do we send money to inmates?
 Currently, in the US, there are 2 ways,

 At some point, doesn’t it just become white noise? When it does and people don’t react, they won’t do it anymore.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Could there be any mathematical reasons behind why algorithms like random forest and xgboost are known to win Kaggle competitions (i.e. perform well for medium sized tabular datasets) compared to deep neural networks and linear regression models?
 Heuristically, here are my general conclusions:
 1) GLM (general linear models) perform best on smaller sized datasets, provided certain statistical assumptions are met.
 2) boosting and bagging algorithms (e.g. random forest and xgboost) perform best on larger ta…</p>

One is from a big4bank for a data analyst internship (pays less) but I believe they use state of art technology and there is a lot to learn; The work is all for internal stuff. The second offer is to work as a project analyst in which I will be working with clients. The company is big but not in the top10 or anything. The advantage of this company is that I’ll be working with clients which means more exposure and connections. They also use near top tech. I&#39;m not sure which one…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Probably not a popular sentiment here but I&#39;m trying to bring some rationality to the conversation. In the past year, the M2 money supply (which isn&#39;t even really quite all the USD there is) has gone from just under $18T to just over $20T. $2.3T has been &quot;printed&quot; in the past 12 months. It&#39;s a 12.8% increase. 
 But around 8M new Eth are created each year. There was a supply of about 108M a year ago. That&#39;s a 7.4% increase but that remains pretty constant when the USD rate is typica…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Today, I learnt that only ~60,000 users in our subreddit have moon vaults active. That&#39;s only 2% adoption rate based on the 3 million users in our subreddit. 
 This is quite surprising since it&#39;s a subreddit based on cryptocurrency and it&#39;s opportunities. 
 It&#39;s free cryptocurrency that can actually change your life. One may even call it a low cap gem. Why miss out? Go and set up your vaults!

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>It’ an elegant way to perform matrix or vector manipulation.
 I find it’s extremely useful if I have to perform matrix multiplication of matrices which is of higher dimension, it gives a great flexibility to sum and multiply among certain axis.
 Ex : if you have to multiply matrix A of shape (1,200,2,32) &amp; matrix B of shape (2,32,32) and results in a matrix C of shape (1,200,32).
 This can be implemented as follows:
 np.einsum(‘abcd,cde-&gt;abe’,A,B)
 That’s it !

                <p>I have north of 100 products with a request to build more accurate forecast for them. For a 1-2 month turnaround, what are folks thought process on the approach: 1) go for each distinct product and determine best model and parameters, or 2) find a higher level hierarchy to reduce cardinality from 100 plus to let’s say 10-12 models which is more manageable. 
 First time working on a ts project and would appreciate your thoughts. Ty!

 They&#39;re both watching the world move on and evolve past them. 
 They&#39;re both trying to seize power against us, and Bitcoin and crypto in general puts some of that power back in our hands.
 They should be afraid. All politicians should. 
 There&#39;s now something out there They can&#39;t take control of.
 It&#39;s beautiful!

                <p>I think it&#39;s a big problem in today&#39;s (US) public education system that we don&#39;t teach personal financial basics in school anymore.
 When I got married a few years ago, my wife and I, in our mid-30&#39;s realized that we had no financial education except the lessons we had learned from our own past mistakes... and those can be expensive. 
 No one is going to beat your door down or drag you to a class to teach you how to handle money.

 Now I’m sure I’m not the only one but - although causal models are the holy grail, due to time and cost and laziness constraints all my models are just association models, not necessarily causal but observational in nature.
 Easy, so I then communicate the associative nature of model and no DO operator or intervention has been modelled at all. E.g. recently and elasticity model i modelled observed price % change against qty sold % change. But then business takes a mental leap and wants to use they mode…</p>

                <p>So, I started my engineering journey with Electrical Engineering but somehow got interested in data science, I learned most of the things on my own, I studied about things required to be in the CS field but felt like I knew nothing and hence asked a few of my CS students to do a project with me so I can learn, they weren&#39;t that motivated so I did somethings myself. I was learning and going good doing my own project.
 Though I didn&#39;t get any jobs in the field because I wasn&#39;t having a CS degree t…</p>

                <p>Hi, I&#39;m trying to construct a model that takes in the first two/three input values from the user and based on those values, decides the best 4th independent variable to ask the user to optimize the time needed to bucket the user into one of the 5-6 different buckets (supervised clusters). The initial approaches that I was considering were bidirectional LSTM/RNN&#39;s.. but after reading up on these two, I&#39;m now thinking there may be more suitable/clever approaches to tackles this.

                <p>Google researcher’s new study suggests modifying the conventional transformer architecture to process byte sequences in natural language processing (NLP). The new competitive byte-level models can effectively balance computational cost trade-offs of contemporary large language models.
 Tokenization splits the sentences into a sequence of tokens. Most NLP tasks follow a tokenization procedure to preprocess the data. However, tokenization can struggle with typos, irregularities in spelling and capitalization,…</p>

 I&#39;m building a tool that asks personalized follow up questions in order to get detailed survey responses. It&#39;s powered in part by GPT-3 (created by OpenAI). If you&#39;re open to testing it, it takes a couple of minutes...and I welcome feedback.
 It&#39;s imperfect, but that&#39;s why we&#39;re testing ;) Please DM me for a link!
 I&#39;d also love to hear your experiences building standalone AI products like this.

                <p>Human-induced climate change may seem a purely modern phenomenon. Even in ancient Greece, however, people understood that human activities can change climate. Later the early United States was a lab for observing this as its settlers altered nature. By 1800 it was known that the mass clearing of forests raised temperatures in the Eastern U.S. and that climatic changes followed the pioneers as they spread west.
 The causes for such changes, and the understanding that they could have global scope, came from e…</p>

                <p>The science you can come across today can often appear to be full of contradictory claims. One study tells you red wine is good for your heart; another tells you it is not. Over the past year, COVID-19 research has offered conflicting reports about the overall effectiveness of wearing a mask. As scientists debate what policy best suits the current moment, they will be drawing on hundreds of studies; some that say masks are effective1 and some that say masks alone are not enough.2
Naturally, given its outsiz…</p>
