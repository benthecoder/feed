And though we both agreed that A.I might replace us soon, I&#39;d like to see some reasons from you guys here as of why A.I can&#39;t replace us (for a different perspective). I&#39;m still wondering if we humans can overcome the rise of A.I and the likelihood of them taking over.

 DSs train models, do exploratory analysis, create variables, validate hypothesis, but don&#39;t put any of that into production themselves.
 Normally Modern (Tech) Companies
 DEs gather and store data.

                <p>I know things look rough in our community. Mania has turned into tribalism. Bitcoin is down more than 30% off it&#39;s all time high and may go down even more. Here&#39;s a little story about why I still believe and will always believe in crypto.
 I was 25 when the 2007-2008 financial crisis hit. I had a great thing going. Married the woman of my dreams and was about to have a kid. Well the insurance brokerage I worked for went belly up. I was staring unemployment in the face with a kid on the way. I was sc…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Some might be asking why is this important. There is a difference between trading crypto, selling crypto, even using crypto in their systems, all different from crypto being on record as a bookmark for assets as proof of wealth. My loan officer had my companies, my portfolio, my properties, even my collectibles on record to keep my lines open and to open new ones, but crypto has never been allowed, can&#39;t even make a note of it, once it is allowed, and THIS should be what excites you, once it is allowed,…</p>

                <p>Hey everyone,
 I’ll be honest I find this community a bit like the boomers of crypto. There’s a lot of complaining and just negativity at times, I hope this community fixes that.
 With that being said, what I’m about to post actually has me concerned.
 So we all know about shitcoins, nothing wrong with them. Think of it as OTC or Pink sheet stocks. Most are shit but you may land a few diamonds in the making, maybe.
 Now my concern is with SafeMoon. It has received a huge popularity due to intense marketing.…</p>

 How to avoid this and forever be in the green pastures?
 Simple as hell, just go to your trading app settings (e.g. Binance) and change the color pattern so that the green color represents losses and red color to represent gains.
 Congratulations, you are now forever in the green.

                <p>I am currently looking for a way to detect if a conversation is occurring. The meaning of the conversation is not important for this case.
 One approach that seems viable is to try to detect a voice that is not the user’s voice. This would most likely work for my purposes. So, does anyone have any resources that can identify whether the voice belongs to a specific user or not?

                <p>Does anyone know a bit more about this, and potential ways that it can be addressed? For a project, I just need to think of an idea of how it can be addressed by some kind of project (though we don&#39;t need to fully design it or anything, just the idea).
 I was thinking of something about data cleansing, word embedding, but I don&#39;t know too much and am not sure how to tie it together.
 If you have more background info about related aspects, that&#39;d be extremely helpful, thanks!

And there were certain limitations associated with autoregressive methods like ELMo and GPT as well. XLNet was introduced to get the best of both worlds while at the same time not include their weaknesses.
 In continuation of my Paper Notes series, I have written an informative summary of the paper. Personally, reading the XLNet paper was a very fun experience. I was amazed at every step, how they were including stuff to ma…</p>

 Think yourself: why should it be over?
 Grayscale, Microstrategy and PayPal are still buying, Tesla is searching for a integration of a power efficient cryptocurrency and almost all major banks are creating a crypto/Bitcoin fund. This is just a pullback like all others. We&#39;ll be back to $60k in 2 weeks - just zoom out :)
 Enjoy these &quot;dippy days&quot; and see it as a healthy correction as well as a great opportunity to buy more

 As of today, he is fully attacking Bitcoin, Bitcoin developers, and calling Bitcoin centralized. Wonder why he is behaving this way? I predicted this.

Soon after you invest, things are actually looking okay and this optimism you feel remains with you. But then things suddenly change and the market just plummets without no forewarning to you.

 If you felt like it was a good investment a week ago, it&#39;s still a good investment now.
 The price of your holdings in the short term are mostly speculation.
 Over the long term, the price will revert to its fundamental value (i.e. what it&#39;s actually worth).

Even if you have $0 in net worth (i.e. no savings/assets but also no debts -- or they cancel out in value), you&#39;re at least in the 28th percentile for net worth in the under-30 age bracket.
 To be better off in terms of net worth than most households under 30 in the US (top half/50th+ percentile), you only need a net worth of $7500 or more.

 Elon Musk replies that he wants to speed up Block time 10X and increase Block size 10X to reduce transaction fee 100X, for Doge Coin. 
 If the solution of blockchain scaling was simply to change the variables, why Adam Beck didn&#39;t think of this and why Satoshi didn&#39;t think of this.

 This is a follow-up to an earlier post comparing Bitcoin&#39;s previous cycles to today. Credits to u/Mutchmore for the initial idea. The chart compares the market cap among all cryptocurrencies relative to time. It uses a logarithmic scale, meaning the growth is proportional (i.e. the growth of $1 to $10 is equal to the growth of $10 to $100). The 20-21 market is green, the 17-18 market is red.

This last year has been a little rough as my wife took a lesser paying job to focus on getting her teacher&#39;s license and I haven&#39;t been able to work as long of hours to take care of my son. But one thing i got into was to throw extra money into some crypto every week.
 I diversified my portfolio as much as possible, made a ton of rookie mistakes. (Chasing that green!, Doge!) But thanks to some luck, a bull market, and minor help from this sub I was able…</p>

                <p>At the risk of this aging unbelievably poorly a few days from now, I just caught a local peak for one of my first-ever crypto purchases in 2017 (which is currently swinging around wildly) and sold off just a little bit of my overall position to reduce my exposure. If things keep going up, I&#39;ll DCA out to recover my initial investment and be in &quot;for free&quot; on the rest of my holdings within a few months.

 I always see these posts a lot, but for some reason more in the past few days:
 &quot;what are the best coins under $X?&quot;
 And sure, it looks like that makes sense - Bitcoin (BTC) is super expensive already, while a coin like BitTorrent (BTT) is available for less than one cent! If you buy some now and they become as expensive as Bitcoin you will be rich! Bitcoin also used to be cheap! Right?
 Lol, nah, wrong…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Hello , Medical doctor here. Ive been learning python. I am interested in transationing my career to work on AI health care related projects while using my background in medicine as back up to help create AI to improve health care. 
 My question is, is there even a job offer that entails this specific thing? 
 I am also looking to take a masters degree in AI. 
 Thank you.

                <p>Hello,
 I finally came to realize that I use almost every libraries as pure blackboxes and that it is a problem (I thought before it was not as soon as you can give the management a correct result) if I want to improve myself professionally speaking.
 I have zero background in mathematics so learning through a university syllabus is very very hard and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to finish that. Would you have any resources that is a bit interactive and noob-friendly ? I enjoyed learning Python and R …</p>

                <p>Hi everyone,
 If you saw a project on a new grads resume which is basically a song recommendation system for Spotify, would you think its a good project or bad one? I only ask as I see many projects with the same premise and I want to know if its been done to death already.
 I&#39;m really interested in the project but I don&#39;t have time as I have to start preparing for job interviews soon and I don&#39;t want to waste time doing a project which won&#39;t help me get an interview. Any thoughts and advice…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Criticism of BTC:
 ✅ Energy inefficient
 ✅ Slow
 ✅ Expensive transactions
 Acting like anything else is delusional and makes all of us look like lunatic cult members. To see people defend Bitcoin this much is kindda embarrassing.
 It&#39;s the first crypto, but it&#39;s a bad one.

                <p>A 2020 peer-reviewed IEEE paper noted that one bitcoin transaction uses 651 kWh, while IOTA uses 0.00016 kWh, meaning IOTA is ~4 million times more energy efficient.

                <p>Thoughts on ALGO? “All” chart on Coinmarketcap shows trades started in mid 2019th at ~$2 but it dumped to $0.30 3 months after, hovered around that price for most of the 2020 and then pumped in 2021 as everything else. 
 I see it mentioned a lot in daily, in a good way, so does anyone want to share any insights about this coin? Is its value increased cause its fundamentals are good or its increasing because, well, everything else is also pumping?

                <p>This hurts your application far more than it helps it.
 I sit in and judge our Data Science interviews for multiple teams for my company in San Francisco almost twice every week. And I swear, almost every applicant throws Machine Learning as a solution to problems we send out in takehomes / in-person interviews / etc.
 In one specific case, we give applicants data to work on for take homes where Machine Learning cannot be applied due to inherent limitations of the data. But almost 9/10 we get candidates who…</p>

                <p>I know that we are all working remotely to an extent now. But, does anyone here have experience with working on a team which is fully remote?
 I am in talk with a recruiter for an exciting position in a fully remote company (well funded startup and recruiter promises a good work-life balance). I have had colleagues in the same location in all the places I worked before- I very much enjoyed the social aspect of office. So being in a fully remote team is something new for me and I am being a bit cautious.

 In the job responsibilities, it mentioned typical responsibilities for a Data Analyst except for &#39;Predictive Analytics&#39;. Isn&#39;t this a Data Scientist&#39;s responsibility? Since it would require knowledge a typical Data Analyst would not know. Would it be fair to mention in the interview? The salary range was 60-70k.

 I&#39;m running this on a company VM which has 16GB RAM I believe.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Hello,
 I&#39;m new and working on a logistic regression model. I have two variables that are (what I would consider) abnormally large at 10.2 and 30.7. I read online that it&#39;s usually a bad sign if this is the case and that this may signal multicollinearity. However, the VIF Factor on these is 1.2 (for both) under the 5.0 that I&#39;ve read signals multicollinearity. Is it OK to leave these in? Should I remove them? Thanks.

 Simply breathing is a difficulty for thousands of people, something we all take for granted. Thousands of deaths everyday in hospitals, on the streets and at home and the hopelessness of being able to get family members the help they need.

                <p>I’ve now seen many people, including the ceo of Binance, comparing bitcoins energy consumption to energy usage in the current financial systems. This is stupid.
 Companies like visa process many multiples more transactions than bitcoin, it’s ridiculous that people are comparing these systems as a whole.
 When you compare the energy usage per transaction bitcoins real problem is shown.

How many times do we see rich people claim to be &#39;for the people&#39; but act like you&#39;re pulling their tooth out when you suggest they spread some of their wealth around for the betterment of society.

 I&#39;m far enough in my DataCamp class that I want to start my first projects. All the classes were in the built in shell in my browser but when I start working my first projects I want to get used on doing it on Linux.
 I&#39;m a Linux nooby and just dabbled into it a few times. Do you have any recommendations? Certain tools/ SW that I should look into?

 Basically how can I make predictions and share them with my superiors where they can see their reliability right away.
 Can you share some resources for such a setup?

 When the leadership team tests the tool they pick a few cases they think they know and gauge results that way. I think this cherry picking will lead to problematic decisions. Are there better ways to test search engine results then large test sets?

                <p>VeChain has been gaining a lot of popularity the recent time due to its real-world use case and increase in value. Still, I don´t think the majority of people realize how good VeChain actually is. I happen to work for one of the biggest companies in the logistics industry, so I might have some views and insights that would interest VeChain fans.
 What is VeChain?
 VeChain is a blockchain-enabled platform that is designed to enhance supply chain management processes. By utilizing tamper-proof and distributed…</p>

                <p>I feel that the biggest exchange listing a shitcoin like Shiba with such a stupid description and lack of use case was greedy and irresponsible to begin with, this dump and the way it came about does not reflect well on their listing criteria. 
 I know they can do as they like with what they list, but listing things like this definitely lowered my opinion of them. 
 I salute VBs move. I do sympathise with some of those who got burned, but that is the risk of shitcoins ladies and gentlemen.

 After a long time rallying against these new coins of little value to the ecosystem, I looked up CumRocket, which the name alone had me assuming it was not worth the time.
 I was surprised with the whitepaper (no pun intended). Deflationary token on BSC, enabling NFT transactions, allowing tokens as means of tipping/NFT purchase. 5% tax on transactions, (2.5% burn, 2.5% reflection to the holders). It&#39;s got more of a use case than Shiba, Doge, etc., arguab…</p>

 Crypto seems to be full of technical codes like ERC-20 and EIP1559, most of which generally go over my head...

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Julian Barbour’s obsession with time began on Oct. 18, 1963. The 26-year-old Cambridge graduate in mathematics was on a train to the Bavarian alps, where he and a friend planned to climb the Watzmann, Germany’s third highest peak. The newspaper in his hand contained a summary of a Scientific American article by British physicist Paul Dirac. “He questioned whether four-dimensional symmetries are a fundamental feature of the physical world,” Barbour recalled. Dirac was pulling apart Einstein’s conception of t…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>It seemed inevitable that Elon Musk would eventually get into a Twitter war over whether Mars can be terraformed. When you’re on Twitter, he told Businessweek in July, 2018, you’re “in meme war land.” “And so essentially if you attack me,” he said, “it is therefore okay for me to attack back.”
 Musk, the CEO and lead designer of SpaceX, wants to “make life multiplanetary,” starting with Mars. “Public support for life on Mars is critical to making it happen,” he tweeted last week. The red planet is relativel…</p>

                <p>In the late afternoon of May 5, SpaceX’s Elon Musk tweeted, “Starship landing nominal!” Musk is not known for understatement. But seeing that stainless steel behemoth soar was, for many, something more like phenomenal. Over 5 million people watched the spectacle on YouTube, perhaps many with bated breath, as every prior attempt at landing Starship had gone up in flames. Not SN15. This Starship, after having climbed 12 kilometers and then coasted down in a “belly flop” configuration—using its wide silver bod…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Applying Deep Learning techniques to complex control tasks depends on simulations before transferring models to the real world. However, there is a challenging “reality gap” associated with such transfers since it is difficult for simulators to precisely capture or predict the dynamics and visual properties of the real world.
 Domain randomization methods are some of the most effective approaches to handle this issue. A model is incentivized to learn features invariant to the shift between simulation and re…</p>

                <p>It is my understanding (and I assume it’s similar with any new technology) that there is a certain level of abstraction we use to think about complex systems. It would be impossible for one human to fully understand all the intricacies of AI software and hardware. So as developers create these technologies, I imagine they are building off old technologies and working at a high level before observing the details of the outputs?

It&#39;s basically the first thing I do when I wake up, and the last thing I glance at when I sleep. I check it while I eat lunch. I check it while I take a #2. After getting stressed out about the ups and downs, I decided I have put my money in coins I believe in and I would stop constantly checking it.
 Well now it finally happened. I haven&#39;t looked at my portfolio in the last 36 hours or so(…</p>

                <p>Recently reading about Cardano on other subreddits and the sentiment is not as jubilant as when cardano is mentioned in this sub. 
 Often when talking about Cardano a comparison is drawn to Tezos and how Tezos is way ahead of Cardano.
 Which got me thinking, why don’t we talk more about Tezos here? How come we hear so much about Cardano instead?

                <p>I&#39;ve recently been trawling through old posts, trying to do some research on coins. One thing that I&#39;ve found valuable that takes just a few seconds is clicking on people&#39;s usernames and looking at their recent post history. A potential red flag for me is that they constantly talk about one coin, or all their recent posts are in that coin&#39;s subreddit.
 Another thing I sometimes find is subtle brigading. All of a sudden, five posts in one thread talking about a certain coin, and all five post…</p>

                <p>The most recent Bitcoin halving took place on 11 May 2020, a year ago today. Bitcoin itself was priced around $8,500, with market dominance around 67%. Eth was around $185... what a difference a year makes!
 However this growth isn&#39;t entirely surprising going by the Bitcoin cycle - the Bitcoin halving event has instigated a bull market on three occasions now.
 While the Bitcoin Rainbow chart isn&#39;t something to base future performance on, its a great way of showing the price action following each hal…</p>

 Look, I thought about selling when it was around 70 cents but didn’t. I wanted to see that sweet Dolla Dolla Bill, Y’all.

                <p>I work at a relatively small, publicly listed bank (corporate hq) as a data analyst intern and both physical and cyber security standards are high. 
 My job, and most people’s job in my department (finance) entails importing data into excel or modifying data from excel. 
 As you may know, excel doesn’t really play nice with all kinds of data. For example, we have excel functions calling a cell from a different sheet. If the new data to be imported is minutely different, it may invalidate the function. Many …</p>

                <p>hey guys, was hoping to ask some data science related questions. i&#39;m a doctor, doing this as a side project. I have some experience with python, pandas and r and have used them to analyze small datasets (ten thousand to few hundred thousand). my question is that i&#39;m now working with a really big dataset (big for me, personally). its about 1.7 terabytes of data which can be divided into chunks of about 200 gb for lets say a year&#39;s worth of data, and then can be further subdivided into multiple ta…</p>

                <p>I am a computer science undergrad student, looking to study M.Sc in Data science in University of Zurich. This is going to be right after my undergrad. Even though I have 10 months internship experience, I feel like it won&#39;t be enough to compete with other candidates with more experience. What additional skills can I have as a data scientist that would make me stand out and make up for the lack of experience. Any advice would be much appreciated

Back when DS got popular, the process was a lot like every other interview process - questions about your resume, some questions about technical topics to make sure that you knew what a person in that role should know, etc.

 I&#39;m thinking about exploring DS in the freelance world. I have started working full time in January, but the position is not very challenging or time consuming and I need more projects. I&#39;m wondering if anyone out there has any experience as a freelancer, consultant, or part-time and what your tips are to be successful? 
 Thanks!

 EDIT: and would anyone else be interested in seeing this sub be more than a flood of career entering and movement threads? If that&#39;s what is wanted great, but I&#39;ve always thought that most of the content in this sub could be contained in a single pinned thread.

                <p>ETH went from around 4150 to 3600 in 15 minutes, I&#39;m guessing a whale dumped a ton of ETH and the new traders started to freak out and thus the panic selling began. But Oh My God, not even 15 minutes later ETH is almost at 4000 again. 
 I must say I am really impressed, even for crypto I&#39;ve never seen anything like it. Sadly I missed it, would have bought more. ETH is so incredibly bullish right now.

 It’s just whales making up for their loss, preparing their bags to invest in stocks that just dipped, pumping it back up and putting that money again in cryptos.

                <p>That scamcoin SHIB single handedly pulled the gas fees from around 20-50 gwei up to 250-300. It&#39;s crippling an entire network, because people are investing on hype. Nothing else. I&#39;m so done. This is not an altcoin-season, this is the shitcoin season. I&#39;m happy for people making a profit, but for every person making a 100$ theres another one losing exactly that. It&#39;s a ponzi scheme. Stop this shit.
 Anyway Let&#39;s go to the Winchester, have a pint and wait for this whole thing to blow over…</p>

 Was very happy, a lot of stuff up, nice profits, etc.
 Checks on fear/greed index &gt; above 70 &gt; well probably sometime this week bear may strike again.
 Time to go to work.
 Checks again, everything red and dropping almost 10%.

 If you&#39;re not margin trading (and if you&#39;re brand new you really shouldn&#39;t be) then you&#39;re just giving yourself hemorrhoids and grey hair freaking out over red candles on the minute charts.

First the ROV travels through the productive sunlit waters, rich with fish and jellies, but as it sinks the light fades, and all that’s left of the sunlit zone are sinking bodies and waste of the creatures above, raining down so softly, and so densely, scientists call it “marine snow.” Then as the snow fades,…</p>

                <p>Many marine biologists identify a gateway drug into their obsession, and for Heather Koldewey, it was the seahorse. Who can blame her? Seahorses seem to have evolved not entirely in the ocean, but also by way of a whimsical storybook, in which animal body parts are all mixed up. A fish with the head of a horse? A male that gets pregnant, gives birth, and is monogamous?

[Epistemic status: my current view, but I haven’t read all the stuff on this topic even in the LessWrong community, let alone more broadly.]
There is a line of thought that says that advanced AI will tend to be ‘goal-directed’—that is, consistently doing whatever makes certain favored outcomes more likely—and that this is to do with the ‘coherence arguments’. Rohin Shah, and probably others1, have argued against this. I want to argue against them.

I just finished Karen Pryor’s “Don’t Shoot the Dog: the New Art of Teaching and Training.” Partly because a friend points out that it’s not on Audible and therefore she can’t possibly read it, here are the notes I took and some thoughts. It’s a quick, easy read.
The book applies behavioral psychology to training animals and people. The author started off as a dolphin trainer at an aquarium park in the 1960s and moved on to horses, dogs, and her own children. There are…</p>
